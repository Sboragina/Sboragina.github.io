          <p>After completing this topic, you will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Recognize when a person with type 1 diabetes is likely to have
              high and low blood sugars, and the symptoms they may exhibit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Appropriately assist the person who is experiencing high or low
              blood sugar
            </li>
            <li>Know when and how to administer glucagon.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In a normal person, blood sugar levels tend to be a constant 5.0
            mmol/L. They may rise slightly after a high-carb meal, or drop after
            exercise, but the body is usually able to quickly get the sugar
            levels back to a steady 5.0 mmol/L or so. A person with type 1
            diabetes has to perform the role of a healthy pancreas. They try to
            time insulin and food so that they reach the bloodstream at the same
            time, giving that straight line. Often, however, their attempts look
            more like a roller-coaster track, soaring into the teens or higher,
            then dipping down into the threes or even twos, and then soaring
            again.
          </p>
          <h2>What causes high or low blood sugar?</h2>
          <p>
            There are many things that affect whether a blood sugar value stays
            steady, increases, or decreases.

          <h3>High Blood Sugar</h3>
          <p>
            A concern with high blood sugars is developing diabetic ketoacidosis
            (DKA). DKA occurs when the body does not get enough insulin, and it
            can be deadly. Because DKA develops due to lack of insulin, it is
            possible for a person to develop it even with normal blood sugar
            levels, for example, if they are sick and haven't taken any insulin
            because they've been vomiting and didn't want to have low blood
            sugars.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person with high blood sugar may need water or a sport drink with
            electrolytes to help flush the glucose out of their body and restore
            the appropriate electrolyte balance. They may avoid food, or only
            eat low-carb foods such as green vegetables, eggs, meat, and cheese.
            Encourage them to take insulin to avoid going into diabetic
            ketoacidosis.
          </p>

          <p>
            A person in DKA needs to go to the hospital for proper treatment.
            This is not a situation that can be fixed at home. It requires
            carefully reintroducing insulin and the appropriate electrolytes,
            and typically requires spending time in the ICU. The longer a person
            in DKA delays in going to the hospital for treatment, the worse
            their outcomes are likely to be.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h3>Low Blood Sugar</h3>
          <p>A concern with low blood sugar is going into a diabetic coma.</p>
          <p>
            A person with low blood sugar needs rapid-acting glucose to raise
            their blood sugar levels quickly. An appropriate correction dose is
            about 15 g of carbohydrates (e.g., 15 skittles or 4 glucose tablets
            or a small juice box). Having an additional follow-up snack with
            protein (e.g., peanut butter) is a good idea because it will help
            keep the blood sugar level steady.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person with low blood sugar who is unconscious or who is dropping
            faster than they can treat on their own may need glucagon. See the
            next section for information about how to administer glucagon.

                One problem people with type 1 diabetes encounter is that
                treating low blood sugar is done simply with food or drink.
                Sometimes it can be hard for others to realize that a packet of
                skittles isn't just a snack, and juiceboxes are used for
                treating low blood sugars and not as a cola alternative.

                  I'm getting fed up with a couple of roommates. They always eat
                  or drink my low treatments and leave me with hardly any left,
                  and they don't even let me know if I'm running low. When I mentioned I only had one
                  juice box left today, one of them responded that it was no big
                  deal&mdash;they'll get more tomorrow. That won't help me if I
                  go low more than once tonight!

            <li>
              Never give the person insulin. If their blood sugar is low, you
              could kill them. If their blood sugar is so high that they are not
              conscious, they need trained medical assistance. This is not
              something that can be treated at home.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's always better to assume the person has low blood sugar and
              bring them something sugary to eat or drink. If their blood sugar
              is high, the little bit of sugar used to correct a low won't make
              a big difference. If they're low, the sugar can save their life.

                  I went out for dinner and drinks with my brother and a friend.
                  We had the drinks first because we were still full from a
                  really late lunch, and the alcohol hit me fast. My insulin
                  pump got knocked off and my friend and brother freaked out,
                  and my friend called 911. There was no issue &hellip; my blood
                  sugar was in range, but they didn't know that. Well, as my
                  friend was calling 911, another person out with us decided I
                  needed insulin and injected me with 100 units! That's more
                  than I take for 3 days! My blood sugar dropped dangerously low
                  in less than 5 minutes, and I passed out due to low blood
                  sugar. EMS did all they could to get me back. Three bags of
                  water plus 5 sugar shots later (I know this from what the
                  doctor told me), I now have to stay in the ICU for 3 days
                  because they have to get this all out of me. Who just gives
                  someone a shot of insulin!? That person almost killed me.

          <h2>Giving glucagon for low blood sugars</h2>
          <p>
            If a person experiencing low blood sugar is unable to eat or drink,
            they may need a glucagon injection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Before giving a person an injection of
            glucagon, make sure you have their permission to use it on them in
            an emergency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Follow the steps in this video to give a glucagon injections (this
            video was designed for parents caring for their children, but
            applies to adults as well, following the directions for a child over
            12 years of age).

            Health Canada recently approved a nasal glucagon kit. The glucagon
            is delivered through a nasal spray instead of requiring an
            injection.

                Type 1 diabetes is rare. Having the "right" genes for type 1
                diabetes doesn't mean a person will develop the disease.
              </li>
              <li>
                People with type 1 diabetes often have relatives with type 1
                diabetes or other autoimmune diseases.

                  <strong>Correct!</strong> Option C is best. Tim is an adult
                  who is responsible for his own decisions. He is not making a
                  healthy choice, but neither is anyone else eating treats at
                  the party. As long as Tim accurately tracks how many carbs he
                  eats and gives an appropriate amount of insulin to cover it,
                  hell be ok, from a blood sugar standpoint. Neither taking away
                  Tim's treat nor second-guessing his decision would help Tim
                  make better decisions in the future; instead, they would build
                  resentment and create distance between Tim and Dave.

                  <strong>Correct!</strong> All of these, and more, affect how
                  much insulin a type 1 diabetic needs. A person with type 1

                  same thing at the same time every day, and there are even more
                  factors to consider when things change.
