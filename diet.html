      <h2>What can a person with type 1 diabetes eat?</h2>
      <p>The short answer is ... anything!</p>
      <p>You are likely familiar with the diet advice given to type 2 diabetics: eat healthy foods that promote weight loss. Weight loss reduces insulin resistance, and reducing insulin resistance can cure type 2 diabetes. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, weight loss does NOT cure type 1 diabetes. </p>
      <p>There is no diet, supplement, spice, essential oil, or other "natural" treatment that can cure type 1 diabetes.<sup>1</sup> Some diets and supplements can reduce insulin resistance, but a person with type 1 diabetes would still need to take insulin, just less of it.</p>

      <p>The primary goal for those with type 1 diabetes is achieving stable, normal-range blood glucose levels. Matching food intake to insulin dosages is critical. Eating a healthy diet that minimizes the risk for heart disease (a leading cause of death for

      <h2>But what about sugar?</h2>
      <p>People often think those with type 1 diabetes can't have sugar. This isn't true. While it's not healthy, it doesn't need to be avoided entirely.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">
        <p>As we saw in the section <a href="">What is Type 1 Diabetes?</a>, the body breaks down all carbohydrates we consume into glucose (sugar). The appropriate dose of insulin to cover the carbohydrates is the same no matter what form the carbohydrates have initially (although how fast the carbohydrates are digested depends on whether they are simple or complex).</p>

      <p>To be fair, sugar is not good for anyone. It's processed, and it quickly spikes blood sugar levels. And, twenty years ago or more, diets prescribed for those with type 1 diabetes (e.g., the diabetic exchange diet) did not permit sugar. However, that approach was largely abandoned because some of those with type 1 diabetes (especially children) developed unhealthy eating habits as a result. They didn't learn to eat to match hunger levels; and many sneaked treats (read about diabulimia and disordered eating in the section on <a href="">Mental Health</a>). People who develop type 1 diabetes can live with this disease for 70 years or more, so a long-term view is generally better. Forcing those with type 1 diabetes to restrict their diet (e.g., avoid sugar) corresponds with them doing more poorly at managing their diabetes. So, if you see a person with type 1 diabetes eating a sugary treat, either leave them alone or subject everyone in the room to the same scolding about the dangers of sugar; don't single out the person with diabetes.</p>

Today after our lunch her mom mentioned that there were desserts but she didn't know if they were diabetic friendly. My friend responded, "Don't worry, Mom. If she wants to eat dessert she knows how to cover it. She can eat what she wants." Mom said, "OK, great!" My little type 1 heart sang with pride and gratitude!</p>

      <p>You've probably seen "diabetic candy" sold at a pharmacy or grocery store. This candy is typically not free from carbohydrates &mdash; it's free from sugar; in addition, it often contains sugar alcohols, which may affect blood glucose levels in those with type 1 diabetes and can cause gastrointestinal issues. Despite the marketing, these candies are best avoided entirely.</p>

      </div>
      <h2>Diets</h2>
      <p>There are many different diet strategies that a person with type 1 diabetes can use to successfully manage their disease. A few of the more common ones are described below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diabetic Exchange diet. This is an older strategy that ensures the person has an appropriate number of calories and a healthy balance of foods every day. It works well for those who follow a consistent schedule, and ensures they eat an appropriate balance of healthy carbohydrates, fats, and proteins each day. However, it is very rigid and doesn't allow a person to eat less or more.</li>
        <li>Carb Counting. This is the strategy most of those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the last 20 years or so use. It is a strategy that allows people to eat the food they want to eat, and can be used together with other diet strategies. The body also converts fat and protein to carbohydrates, so some people also count the fat and protein content of their foods, particularly if they follow an extremely low-carbohydrate diet (e.g., keto) or the paleo diet. <br />

            <span class="img-desc"><a href="carb-video-text.html" target="blank">Text Equivalent of Video: What is Carb Counting?</a></span></li>
        <li>Diets that reduce the amount of insulin needed per day. Insulin is life-saving. It is not something to be feared or avoided. However, by reducing the insulin required to cover food, there is less chance for measurement error and smaller consequence for any measurement error that does occur, avoiding the roller coaster blood sugars than can plague those with type 1 diabetes. Different diets achieve this reduction in insulin requirements in different ways. The keto diet involves eating very few carbohydrates in a day, which means very little insulin is needed to cover food. On the other hand, high-carb low-fat plant-based diets do this by increasing insulin sensitivity so less insulin is needed to cover a greater number of carbohydrates.</li>
        <li>Sugar Surfing. This technique involves frequent blood sugar monitoring and correcting. It can be used with any of the other strategies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As you can see, there's a wide range of diet options available to a person with type 1 diabetes. The best option is the one that aligns with their other health concerns (e.g., Celiac disease and kidney disease are associated with type 1 diabetes), and their personal goals and lifestyle.</p>
      <div class="recap">
        <h3>Key Take-aways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The best diet strategy for a person with type 1 diabetes depends on many factors.</li>
          <li>Any change to the person's diet will require the person to do a lot of work to figure out appropriate dosing strategies.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Timing Insulin Action with Food</h2>
      <p>There are two challenges a person with type 1 diabetes faces when eating:</p>
<ul>
<li>HOW MUCH insulin to take, and </li>
<li>WHEN to take it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For someone without diabetes, as the person eats and the food is digested and converted to glucose, the body reacts to the presence of glucose in the bloodstream by releasing appropriate amounts of insulin into the bloodstream to maintain a good glucose level. This insulin reaches the bloodstream immediately, and as needed. </p>
<p>A person with type 1 diabetes injects insulin into fat tissue. Modern rapid-acting insulins (see more about insulins in <a href="">Medications and Devices</a>) takes about 15 minutes for the insulin to travel from the fat to the bloodstream. Depending on the composition of the food, it may be digested and converted to glucose quickly or slowly. Timing the insulin injection so that insulin reaches the bloodstream at the same time the glucose levels start to rise is challenging.<p>
<p>Most people with type 1 diabetes respond to this challenge through routines and preparation. A common strategy is to inject insulin about 15 minutes before eating. However, certain situations make this strategy hard to apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the amount of carbohydrates in the food is unknown (e.g., the food was prepared by someone else)</li>
<li>when the amount of food that will be eaten is unknown </li>
<li>when the time the food will be served is unknown</li>
</ul>

      <div class="col-sm-9">
        <p>I struggle with Holiday meals. There is pressure to eat in time with others, but the time the food is served and the carb count is not predictable. Usually I try to watch my cgm to see what my blood sugar is doing before the meal and prepare as best I can. I often do end up forgoing most of the carb-laden stuff and stick with turkey and simple veggie choices. Although there's always the host who encourages me to fill my plate. I count myself fortunate when they understand my struggles!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
      <h2>Food Autonomy</h2>
      <p>One of the major challenges people with type 1 diabetes face is when others try to regulate their food. It can be frustrating and, if done in public, humiliating. In fact, people with the best management of their diabetes experience a lot of autonomy. Those who experience overprotective behaviour often do worse.</p>

He is not making a healthy choice, but neither is anyone else eating treats at the party. As long as Tim accurately tracks how many carbs he eats and gives an appropriate amount of insulin to cover it, he'll be ok, from a blood sugar standpoint. Neither taking away Tim's treat nor second-guessing his decision would help Tim achieve better control over his blood sugars; instead, these actions would build resentment and create distance between Tim and Dave.</p>
