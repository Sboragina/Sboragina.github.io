          <h2>
            Does a person with type 1 diabetes REALLY need to take insulin?
          </h2>

          <p>
            Yes, insulin is the <strong>only</strong> required treatment for
            type 1 diabetes. If a person with type 1 diabetes has other health
            concerns, they may take other medications (e.g., Metformin for
            insulin resistance; statins to prevent cardiovascular disease), but
            these may not be necessary. Insulin is <strong>required</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3>A note about insulin</h3>
          <p>
            The first types of insulin used to treat those with type 1 diabetes
            came from beef and pork. These insulins are rarely used today,
            although they can be accessed for those who specifically require
            them.<sup>1</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the XXs, scientists figured out how to create human insulin in
            the lab. Human insulin is what the human body naturally creates in
            the pancreas. Insulin is a protein. This means it is complex and
            can't be built piece by piece. Instead, scientists inserted the gene
            for making insulin into <em>e. coli</em> bacteria so that they
            produced human insulin. This insulin is called regular (or R)
            insulin.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a person without diabetes, the pancreas sends insulin directly
            into the portal vein which takes it straight to the liver to be used
            as needed. Those with type 1 diabetes inject insulin into fat
            tissue. The insulin is then absorbed into the blood circulating
            throughout the body, eventually reaching the liver. Human insulin
            takes about 4 hours to fully peak. This isn't ideal for people who
            don't follow a strict eating schedule (see more about eating in the
            section on <a href="diet.html" target="_self">Food</a>).
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <p>picture of pathway of insulin?</p>
          <p>
            To address this timing issue, other insulins have been developed.
            These insulins are called insulin analogs or synthetic insulin. Some
            work rapidly, while others are slow and steady. <sup>2</sup>
          </p>

          <p></p>

          <p>
            The goal is for the injected insulin to match the natural process.
            This means that the timing of the insulin injection is extremely
            important. If a person feels uncomfortable injecting in front of
            others, they may be more concerned about others' reactions than
            their own health.

          <h3>How is insulin used?</h3>
          <p>
            A person with type 1 diabetes typically uses insulin in two
            different ways:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-acting</strong> or
              <strong>basal insulin</strong> makes sure that a little insulin is
              always present in the person's bloodstream. This insulin allows
              the person's brain cells, for example, to use glucose to function
              even while the person is sleeping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>rapid-acting insulin</strong> is used to absorb the
              glucose created by the digestion of food.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>picture of both insulins used together in a day</p>

          <h3>Devices used to deliver insulin</h3>
          <p>
            A person on multiple daily injections (MDI) uses syringes or insulin
            pens to inject insulin. They typically take an injection of
            long-acting insulin once a day, and injections of rapid-acting
            insulin every time they eat or when they need to lower a high blood
            sugar.
          </p>

          <p>picture of injection with pen and/or syringe</p>

          <p>
            A person on an insulin pump typically only uses rapid-acting
            insulin. The pump delivers the insulin through a plastic cannula
            inserted into fat. The basal insulin settings give a tiny amount of
            insulin every five minutes. The bolus settings control how much
            insulin is given for a meal or correction. The insulin pump does not
            automatically determine how much insulin to give, it just
            facilitates the delivery of the insulin.
          </p>

          <p>picture of pump(s)</p>

          <p>
            The tools a person uses to inject insulin depends on a number of
            factors: what they are comfortable using, whether they have any fear
            of injections, whether they mind having a device always attached to
            their body.
          </p>

          <h3>Dangers of insulin</h3>
          <p>
            Insulin is a dangerous drug. Too much or too little can be fatal. A
            person with type 1 diabetes may be very sensitive to insulin. A
            woman with type 1 diabetes may take about 40 units of insulin a day,
            about 7 units with each meal. In contrast, a woman with type 2
            diabetes may take 150 units of insulin a day. When a health provider
            assumes that a patient with diabetes has type 2 diabetes, they may
            administer doses of 10 units or more at a time, which can be fatal
            for an insulin-sensitive person with type 1 diabetes.
          </p>

          <p>story</p>

          <p>
            Insulin pumps can (and have) malfunctioned. People wearing them
            should be aware of the possibility, what to look out for, and how to
            quickly respond to avoid or deal with emergencies that result. (read
            more about this in
            <a href="blood-levels.html" target="_self"
              >High and Low Blood Sugars</a
            >)
          </p>
          <p>
            There is danger even with syringes/pens. Typically, a person takes
            about 50% of their daily dose of insulin as basal and 50% as bolus.
            If a person accidentally takes the rapid-acting insulin when they
            meant to take the long-acting insulin, they need to have the
            equivalent of a full day's worth of carbohydrates within the next
            two hours.

            <h3>Key Take-aways</h3>

              <li>People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin.</li>
              <li>
                The timing of insulin injections can determine the person's
                blood sugar levels for the next few hours. It is crucial that
                the person feels free to take the insulin at the time they judge
                best.
              </li>
              <li>
                They take 2 types of insulin: long-acting or basal to cover what
                the body needs to operate, and short-acting or bolus to cover
                food that has been digested.
              </li>
              <li>
                They may use syringes, insulin pens, or insulin pumps to deliver
                insulin.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2>How often do blood sugar levels need to be checked?</h2>
          <p>
            Every person with type 1 diabetes should have a meter for testing
            their blood sugar. Blood sugar levels should be tested frequently.
            The person with type 1 diabetes and their diabetes health care team
            will decide when and how often is best for the person to test.
            Typically, it is recommended for a person with type 1 diabetes to
            test at least 4 times a day: Before breakfast, lunch, supper, and
            bedtime. They may also test more frequently when sick or exercising.

            Some people can feel when their blood sugar is low or high (see more
            about these signs in
            <a href="blood-levels.html" target="_self"
              >High and Low Blood Sugar</a
            >). However, X% of those with type 1 diabetes cannot tell whether
            their blood sugar is in range. For these people in particular, it is
            important to have additional tools to alert them to out-of-range
            blood sugar levels.
          </p>

          <h3>Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)</h3>
          A CGM is a device a person wears that monitors the sugar level in the
          person's interstitial fluid (the water around the fat cells). A
          transmitter on the device sends these numbers to the person's cell
          phone, insulin pump, or other receiver so the person can see their
          blood sugar and whether it's trending up, down, or flat. It allows the
          person to make real-time decisions about their activity, food, and
          insulin needs.
          <p></p>
          <p>pic of numbers on a pump screen</p>
          <p>
            Some CGMs can be set up so that current glucose levels or alerts are
            shared with others through their smartphones.
          </p>
          <p>Show story of having others check in</p>
          <p>
            CGMs aren't as accurate as blood glucose meter results for the
            current blood glucose level. Insterstitial fluid readings tend to be
            about 15 minutes behing blood glucose readings. This means the cgm
            may not be able to catch rapid drops in blood sugar before a person
            experiences a hypoglycemic emergency.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the benefits of CGMs is that they can work with insulin
            pumps. The cgm can send current blood glucose levels to the insulin
            pump, which responds by increasing or decreasing the amount of
            insulin it delivers. This system can help those with type 1 diabetes
            achieve better control while reducing the diabetes burden (see
            <a href="mental-health.html" target="_self">Mental Health</a>).
          </p>
          <h3>Diabetic Alert Dogs</h3>
          <p>
            Those with hypoglycemia unawareness or a thyroid disease like
            Addison's that can cause extreme drops in blood glucose may use a
            diabetic alert dog to help monitor their blood glucose levels. Dogs
            can be trained to smell and alert when a person's blood sugar is too
            low or too high. They can also be trained to support the person
            experiencing extreme hypoglycemia by bringing them their blood sugar
            meter and juice and alerting others.
          </p>

            The following video shows NHL player Max Domi and his diabetic alert
            dog Orion. You can also see Max's insulin pump. Max also speaks
            about how often he tests his blood sugar before, during, and after a

            Training a dog to pick up on blood sugar scents can often be done
            fairly quickly. in fact, some dogs (and cats) are natural alerters.
            However, for a dog to be considered a service dog, with full legal
            privileges, it must also have public access training. This part of
            the training is more time-consuming, and typically takes about 2
            years.

                A blood glucose meter is used to measure blood glucose levels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Before driving, a person with type 1 diabetes should always
                check blood glucose levels and make sure they are above 5.0
                mmol/L.
              </li>
              <li>
                CGMs provide real-time data and trends that can be analyzed.
                They can make it easy to discreetly check blood sugar numbers
                and they allow others to be notified of out-of-range blood
                sugars.
              </li>
              <li>
                Diabetic Alert Dogs can smell when a person's blood glucose is
                out of range and can alert the person to take action
                immediately.

          <h2>Ketones</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to monitoring blood glucose levels, those with type 1
            diabetes must also monitor ketones. Ketones develop when there is
            not enough insulin in a person's system, so the kidneys flush
            glucose.
          </p>
          <p>
            When high levels of ketones are present, the person is in danger of
            developing diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition (see
            more in
            <a href="blood-levels.html" target="_self"
              >High and Low Blood Sugars</a
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            The person can check for ketones using urine strips or a blood meter
            similar to a blood glucose meter.
