<h2>What is the difference between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes?</h2>
<h3>Diabetes</h3>
<p>Diabetes is a group of diseases that result in high blood glucose (sugar) levels. Cells in the body need glucose to function. Insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas, lets the glucose enter the cells. In a person with diabetes, either no (or very little) insulin is being produced or the insulin does not work very well (this is called insulin resistance).</p>
<h3> Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
<p>You probably already know a lot about type 2 diabetes. This is the "diabetes" shown on television ads. The dramatic growth in type 2 diabetes cases is related to the current obesity epidemic in North America, and is a major cause of concern. </p>
<p>Sometimes these ads can be a bit misleading, though. Not ALL people with type 2 diabetes get it from being obese and inactive. Type 2 diabetes occurs when a person's pancreas can't produce enough insulin, often due to insulin resistance. In fact, their pancreas may be producing much more insulin than a healthy person needs, but the insulin resistance means the body is not able to use the insulin properly. Stomach fat, in particular, is a cause of insulin resistance, which is why losing weight can reverse type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>As type 2 diabetes progresses, the high blood sugars damage the pancreas's ability to produce insulin. So, a person with type 2 diabetes may need to start taking insulin even if they are able to lower their insulin resistance.</p>
<h3>Type 1 Diabetes and other types of diabetes</h3>
<p>Did you know there are other types of diabetes? Approximately 90% of those with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, but the remainder of those with diabetes have type 1 diabetes or diabetes due to other causes (e.g., cystic fibrosis, Maternal diabetes and deafness, pancreas removal), sometimes called type 3c diabetes. These types of diabetes are not caused by a person's activity level, weight, or age. </p>
<h3>Type 1 Diabetes: An Autoimmune Disease</h3>
<p>In this module, we'll look at Type 1 diabetes. It is an autoimmune disease. In autoimmune diseases, the body's immune system mistakenly identifies a healthy part of the body as a foreign invader and destroys it! In the case of type 1 diabetes, the body attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.</p>

<p>video of type 1 diabetes?</p>

<p>Autoimmune diseases have a genetic component and an environmental trigger. </p>
<p>For type 1 diabetes, the autoimmune attack is gradual. Usually, it takes several years for it to progress from antibodies in the bloodstream to elevated blood sugars. However, once blood sugars begin to elevate, it's important to act fast! The person can go into diabetic ketoacidosis quickly. In fact, the speed of the disease progression is one sign that a person has type 1 diabetes and not type 2.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed at any age after about 6 months. The younger a person is when diagnosed, the stronger and faster the autoimmune attack tends to be. The most common age for people to be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes is around 14 years old.</p> 

<p>Graph showing distribution of age at diagnosis</p>

<p>Type 1 diabetes used to be referred to a juvenile diabetes because it is often diagnosed in childhood. However, the disease is chronic. It doesn't go away. It doesn't get easier. It doesn't change into a different form of diabetes. Although a person may be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a child, they live most of their lives with the disease as an adult.</p>

<h2>Who is at risk of developing Type 1 Diabetes?</h2>
<p>The risk of developing diabetes is about 1 in XX.</p>
<p>Recall that autoimmune diseases have a genetic component and an environmental trigger. A person with the genes associated with type 1 diabetes still has less than a 10% chance of developing the disease.</p>
<p>In type 1 diabetes, the genetic component is a marker on chromosome 6. The genes associated with type 1 diabetes are more common among Caucasians than those of African, Chinese, or South American descent.<sup>1</sup> <br /> source:https://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/type-1-diabetes/type-1-diabetes-risk-factors</p>
<p>The trigger is often attributed to a viral illness. Viruses that may trigger type 1 include German measles, coxsackie, and mumps. People are more likely to contract viral illnesses when it's cold outside. Those who live in northern climates are more likely to develop type 1 diabetes than those who live in southern climates, and more cases of type 1 diabetes are diagnosed in winter than in summer.- same source</p>

<h3>Family history of Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
<p>A person is slightly more likely to develop type 1 diabetes if there is a family history of diabetes. A study of children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes found about 30% had someone with type 1 diabetes in their extended family. (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005485/). Data for the US show that about 0.3% of the population has type 1 diabetes, but those with a first-degree relative have about a 5% risk of developing it. source: https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/37/7/2034</p>
<p>Here are some data about the risks of developing type 1 diabetes if an immediate family member has it.</p>
<p>A person's risk of developing type 1 diabetes is</p>
<ul>
<li> about 6% if the person's father has it;</li>
<li> about 4% if the person's mather has it AND gave birth to the person before age 25;</li>
<li> about 1% if the person's mather has it AND gave birth to the person at age 25 or older;</li>
<li> as high as 25% if both parents were diagnosed with it before the age of 11;</li>
<li> about 50% if a parent also has a condition called type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (about 14% of people with type 1 diabetes have this syndrome);</li>
<li>about 5% if a sibling has it, but neither parent has it; or </li>
<li>about 50% if an identical twin has it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family history of autoimmune diseases</h3>

<p>Autoimmune diseases tend to cluster, both in individuals and in families. Type 1 diabetes is not common, and many people with type 1 diabetes are the only ones in their family with the disease. However, their family members often have other autoimmune diseases. A study of children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes found about 22% had an immediate family member with an autoimmune disease (vs. 12.9% in those without type 1 diabetes) and 72% had someone with an autoimmune disease in their extended family (vs. 62% in those without type 1 diabetes). (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005485/).
<p>Autoimmune diseases that may be present in family members of those with type 1 diabetes include the following:<sup>1</sup></p>
