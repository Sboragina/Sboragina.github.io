<h2>What is type 1 diabetes?</h2>
<p>You probably already know a lot about type 2 diabetes. This is the "diabetes" shown on television ads. The dramatic growth in type 2 diabetes cases is related to the current obesity epidemic in North America, and is a major cause of concern. Just to be clear, though, not ALL people with type 2 diabetes get it from being obese and inactive.</p>
<p>But, did you know there are other types of diabetes? Approximately 90% of the diabetic population has type 2 diabetes, but the remainder of those with diabetes have type 1 diabetes or diabetes due to other causes (e.g., cystic fibrosis, Maternal diabetes and deafness, pancreas removal). These types of diabetes are not caused by a person's activity level, weight, or age. </p>
<p>In this module, we'll look at Type 1 diabetes. It is an autoimmune disease, which means the body's immune system mistakenly identified a part of the body as a foreign invader and destroyed it! In the case of type 1 diabetes, the body attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.</p>

<p>video of type 1 diabetes?</p>

<p>Autoimmune diseases have a genetic component and an environmental trigger. This means that the person's genes are susceptible to developing an autoimmune disease and then something, like getting a viral illness like Epstein-Barr, starts the autoimmune attack.</p>
<p>In the case of type 1 diabetes, the attack is gradual. Usually, people with type 1 diabetes take several years for it to progress from antibodies in the bloodstream to elevated blood sugars. However, once blood sugars begin to elevate, it's important to act fast! The person can go into diabetic ketoacidosis quickly. In fact, it is the speed of the disease progression that is one sign that a person has type 1 diabetes and not type 2.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed at any age after about 6 months. The younger a person is when diagnosed, the stronger the autoimmune attack tends to be. The most common age for people to be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes is around 14 years old.</p> 

<p>Graph showing distribution of age at diagnosis</p>

<p>Type 1 diabetes used to be referred to a juvenile diabetes because it was often diagnosed in childhood. However, the disease is chronic. It doesn't go away. It doesn't get easier. It doesn't change into a different form of diabetes. Although a person may be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a child, they live most of their lives with the disease as an adult.</p>

<h3> Autoimmunity</h3>
<p>Autoimmune disease tend to cluster, both in individuals and in families. Type 1 diabetes is not common, and many people with type 1 diabetes are the only ones in their family with the disease. However, their family members often have other autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases that may be present in family members of those with type 1 diabetes include the following:<sup>1</sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Addison's disease</li>
<li>ankylosing spondylitis</li>
<li>autoimmune thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease)</li>
<li>celiac disease</li>
<li>multiple sclerosis</li>
<li>pernicious anemia</li>
<li>primary biliary cirrhosis</li>
<li>psoriasis</li>
<li>rheumatoid arthritis</li>
<li>systemic lupus erythematosus</li>
<li>vitiligo</li>
<li>Wegener's granulomatosis</li>

As long as Tim accurately tracks how many carbs he eats and gives an appropriate amount of insulin to cover it, hell be ok, from a blood sugar standpoint. Neither taking away Tim's treat nor second-guessing his decision would help Tim make better decisions in the future; instead, they would build resentment and create distance between Tim and Dave.</p>
