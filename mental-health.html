          <p>After completing this topic, you will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Respect the additional challenges, particularly emotional and

              Determine an appropriate balance between desiring to help,
              protect, or advise and respecting the person's autonomy to make
              their own decisions.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <!--p>
            Managing type 1 diabetes is all about numbers and measurements and
            preparing for the unexpected. It involves constant thought about:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The carbohydrate (and protein and fat) content of foods, and the
              corresponding insulin-to-carb (or fat or protein) ratios,
              correction factors
            </li>
            <li>
              The timing of insulin injections, whether because the person's on
              a strict insulin regimen or because they want to avoid blood sugar
              spikes when eating
            </li>
            <li>A1c results</li>
            <li>Time-in-range</li>
            <li>Others</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Following predictable routines can help, but it's a disease that
            keeps changing. And it can be exhausting to effectively analyze all
            the data that is generated.
          </p-->
          <p>
            Managing type 1 diabetes is all about numbers and measurements and
            timing and preparing for the unexpected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Managing type 1 diabetes is unique in that the patient doesn't
            simply follow the doctor's orders and take a prescribed amount of
            insulin every day until the doctor makes the next adjustment.
            Instead, it is the person with type 1 diabetes who decides how much
            insulin (a drug that is both life-saving and deadly) to take every
            time they inject. And the appropriate dose depends on so many
            factors: what they plan to eat, how active they've been, if they're
            ill or taking other drugs like steroids, if they are stressed, etc.
            They follow guidelines provided by their health team, but the
            day-to-day decisions are theirs alone.
          </p>

          <h2>Mental Burden of Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
          <p>Living with type 1 diabetes can be</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>overwhelming:</strong> normal life activities have to be
              planned, and there are so many things to measure, record, and
              evaluate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>complex:</strong> many factors have to be considered even
              to determine an appropriate dose of insulin to take with a meal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>constant:</strong> a person with type 1 diabetes makes
              about 180 health-related decisions each day.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>unforgiving:</strong> the risk of complications never goes
              away, and bad things may happen despite the person's best efforts
              to manage the disease.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>uncertain:</strong> it's often unclear whether a symptom
              is related to diabetes or diabetic complications or another
              problem, and this uncertainty can breed worry and anxiety.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            People have different priorities. And achieving good clinical
            outcomes is not always at the top of the list. Some want good
            control over blood sugar levels to increase their lifespan and
            support better physical health, others find being free of the daily
            diabetes burden more desirable and choose to focus less meticulously
            on the daily self-management.
          </p>
          <h2>Emotional Burden of Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to managing all of the data that they generate, those
            with type 1 diabetes have to manage the emotional toll that comes
            with having a chronic illness.

              "I had an overnight in the ICU after having DKA symptoms on and
              off for a few weeks. I tried to pull out of it, staying super
              hydrated, eating bananas, taking my multivitamins, checking my
              ketones, etc. Unfortunately, things out of my control like work
              and general life stressors kicked in, and I went into DKA.
              I got through the physical aspects of it OK. I mean, it wasn't
              pleasant, but I can tolerate a lot of physical pain by this point.
              And the staff at the hospital were fantastic: they had positive
              attitudes, they were joking with me, and most importantly, I felt
              like they listened to me and respected my knowledge of my body and
              this disease. But now I'm really struggling with the mental and
              emotional tsunami that comes after:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The fear. Thinking about my mortality and all the what ifs. One
                of the doctors asked me if I had a DNR, and it really freaked me
                out. It made me question everything.
              </li>
              <li>
                The shame. I drove myself to the ER. I didn't want to bother
                anyone or be a burden or make them wait in that awful ER waiting
                room. I only told my boss because I was supposed to work the
                next day, and my roommates so they would feed my pets. I still
                haven't told my parents because I have felt so judged in the
                past. I don't want to tell my friends ... I'm not sure why.
              </li>
              <li>The anger that I couldn't control it.</li>
              <li>The exhaustion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I just want a body that functions properly."</p>

          <h3>Other people's responses</h3>
          <p>
            A big part of the emotional burden is dealing with the responses of
            others towards type 1 diabetes. Other people's negative or
            unexpected responses can make them feel emotionally vulnerable,
            especially when the responses exhibit misconceptions and lack of
            understanding, particularly about the differences between type 1 and
            type 2 diabetes. Confusing the two types of diabetes has a major
            emotional impact on those with type 1 diabetes and causes feelings
            of frustration, anger, and a sense of not being understood or of
            being judged. Fortunately, meaningful relationships and good social
            support are stabilizing and help those with type 1 diabetes feel
            more in control<sup>1</sup>.
          </p>
          <h2>Depression and Diabetes Distress<sup>1</sup></h2>
          <p>
            People with type 1 diabetes have a greater risk of developing
            depression than those without a chronic illness. But they're also
            likely to develop something similar: diabetes distress. Diabetes
            distress is related to depression, but is measured using different
            scales:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>emotional burden (similar to depression)</li>
            <li>regimen distress</li>
            <li>physician-related distress</li>
            <li>interpersonal distress</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Interestingly, when depression is detected and treated in a person
            with type 1 diabetes, their depression improves, but not their
            diabetes control. When diabetes distress is detected and treated,
            the distress improves and so does the diabetes control.
          </p>
          <h3>Diabetes Burnout</h3>
          <p>
            The day-to-day effort required to manage diabetes can be hard and
            frustrating, especially when the results don't match the effort the
            person is putting into managing the disease. At some stage, most
            people with type 1 diabetes experience worries, fear, and negative
            feelings. This can lead to diabetes burnout.
          </p>
          <p>
            Burnout is more than feeling a little down. It includes overwhelming
            feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. It is one of the major
            psychological complications of diabetes. Signs include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>not checking blood sugar levels</li>
            <li>stopping or reducing insulin injections</li>
            <li>not caring about eating habits or exercise</li>
            <li>trying to ignore or forget that they have diabetes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Ways for managing the emotional side of diabetes include the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Rewarding good behaviours, like checking blood sugar levels more
              often, regardless of what number shows up on the meter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Talking about blood sugar numbers as "high" and "low" and NOT
              "good" or "bad", and framing these numbers as information to be
              used rather than as reflections on the person.

              it as a reminder that I'm different from everyone else. Why should
              I even bother trying? Why should I give myself all these needles
              that cause me pain if I'm just going to end up with these

          <h2>Fear of Low Blood Sugars</h2>
          <p>
            Extreme low blood sugars are scary. They can even be fatal,
            especially if they occur at night while the person is asleep.
            Because experiencing low blood sugar is unpleasant and can be
            embarassing if it happens in public, those with type 1 diabetes try
            to avoid it. Total avoidance is difficult, however. In one study,
            36% of those with type 1 diabetes reported going into a coma due to
            low blood sugars at least once in their life. These extreme low
            blood sugars are often feared as much as diabetic complications.
            Some people with type 1 diabetes fear low blood sugars so much they
            deliberately keep their blood sugars higher than desireable, risking
            the long-term consequences of diabetic complications.

              "I went low at work today after a lunch with my team. By the time
              we got back to the office, my sugar level was really low even
              though I had just eaten. I had a juice box, but it didn't help,
              and I started to lose control of my hands and couldn't get the
              next box open. I asked for some help with my juice box and my
              coworkers called 911. Soon, there were 5 people in my cube and
              paramedics and a stretcher to take me to the hospital. By this
              time, my blood sugar was back to normal, so I signed off to deny
              transportation to the hospital. But while all this was going on, I
              started crying and my muscles started jerking around and my
              co-workers got to see first-hand how horrid this disease is. My
              boss sent me home, but wouldn't let me drive, so I had to wait for
              my husband to come pick me up. Now I'm super embarassed. How am I
              supposed to go back and face these people?"

          <h2>Diabulimia and Disordered Eating</h2>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, a higher than normal proportion of those with type 1
            diabetes develop eating disorders. Conservative estimates put the
            rate at about double the normal rate of eating disorders. The BBC
            documentary XXX claimed that 60% of all women with type 1 diabetes
            have experienced it.

              "It often feels like food is my enemy. I was diagnosed a long time
              ago, when type 1 diabetics were put on a pretty stringent eating
              regime. There's a reason they discovered an increase in young type
              1 diabetic girls developing eating disorders. At the time, I
              remember setting up my meal plan with my dietitian and talking
              about "exchanges" (fats, proteins, or starches), and just wanting
              her permission (or anyone's!) to EAT food. I just felt like it was
              better to have fewer exchanges on my meal plan. I'm guessing that
              feeling came from the pressure to keep everything (sugars, weight,
              and therefore, food) LOWER."

            One particular form of disordered eating unique to those with type 1
            diabetes is called diabulimia. It involves not covering food with
            enough (or any) insulin. This means the body cannot use all the
            glucose it takes in (in the form of food), and the kidneys do as
            much as they can to flush the unused glucose out in the urine. The
            person with diabetes loses weight, but experiences high blood
            glucose levels which can lead to DKA or diabetic complications.

              ago. Dave sees Tim grab a candy bar treat. Dave considers the

                <strong>Correct!</strong> Option C is best. Tim is an adult who
                is responsible for his own decisions. He is not making a healthy
                choice, but neither is anyone else eating treats at the party.
                As long as Tim accurately tracks how many carbs he eats and
                gives an appropriate amount of insulin to cover it, he'll be ok,
                from a blood sugar standpoint. Neither taking away Tim's treat
                nor second-guessing his decision would help Tim achieve better
                control over his blood sugars; instead, these actions would
                build resentment and create distance between Tim and Dave.
