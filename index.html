      <p>The short answer is ... anything!</p>
      <p>You are likely familiar with type 2 diabetes, and a diet goal commonly associated with managing it: eating healthy foods that promote weight loss (which reduces insulin resistance). Reducing insulin resistance can cure type 2 diabetes. However, it cannot cure type 1 diabetes (although people with type 1 diabetes can also have high levels of insulin resistance).</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p>There is no supplement, combination of spices, oil or other "natural" treatment that can cure type 1 diabetes. Some of these things can affect insulin sensitivity/resistance, but that is not enough to cure a person with type 1 diabetes. It would merely affect how much insulin they would need to take to cover their foods.</p>

        <h3>Karen's story</h3>
        <p>What really bothers me is when others tell me my sugar would be more controlled and I could get off insulin if I changed my diet. I can't get off insulin! Even if I only drank water and ate no carbohydrates, I'd still need to inject insulin to live. My pancreas doesn't produce insulin!</p>

       <p>The primary goal for those with type 1 diabetes is achieving stable, normal-range blood glucose levels. Matching food intake to insulin dosages is critical. Eating a healthy diet that minimizes the risk for heart disease (a leading cause of death for persons with diabetes) is also important. </p>

<h3> Key Take-aways</h3>

<li>NO diet will eliminate the person's need for insulin. </li>

<h2>But what about sugar?</h2>
<p>People often think those with type 1 diabetes can't have sugar. This isn't true. A type 1 diabetic may experience a blood sugar spike if eating sugar, but it doesn't need to be avoided entirely.</p></div>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
<p>As you may remember from SECTION 1, the body breaks down all carbohydrates we consume into glucose (sugar). The appropriate dose of insulin to cover the carbohydrates is the same no matter what form the carbohydrates have initially (although the timing of the dose depends on whether they are simple or complex carbohydrates!).</p>
</div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
<p>Illustration: 20 g of carbohydrates from mashed potatoes -> 20 g of glucose;  20 g of carbohydrates from a candy bar -> 20 g of glucose</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
<p>To be fair, sugar is not good for anyone. It's processed, and quickly spikes blood sugar levels. While in the past, diets prescribed for those with type 1 diabetes (e.g., the diabetic exchange diet) did not permit sugar, that approach was largely abandoned because some of those with type 1 diabetes (especially children) developed unhealthy eating habits as a result. They didn't learn to eat to match hunger levels; and many sneaked treats (read about diabulimia and disordered eating in the section on Mental Health). People can live with this disease for 70 years or more, so a long-term view is generally better. Forcing those with type 1 diabetes to restrict their diet (e.g., avoid sugar) corresponds with them doing more poorly at managing their diabetes. So, if you see a person with type 1 diabetes eating a sugary treat, either leave them alone or subject everyone in the room to the same scolding about the dangers of sugar; don't single out the person with diabetes.</p>

<h3>Meg's story</h3>
<p>I once went out for a drink with friends. I had a skittle cocktail and my friend's friend put her hand in my drink, grabbed a bunch of skittles out of the bottom of my drink, dumped them in her drink, and then told me I shouldn't be eating sugar. I was so angry and disgusted!</p>

<p>You've probably seen "diabetic candy" sold at a pharmacy or grocery store. This candy is typically not free from carbohydrates &mdash; it's free from sugar; in addition, it often contains sugar alcohols, which may affect blood glucose levels in those with type 1 diabetes and can cause gastrointestinal issues. Despite the marketing, these candies are best avoided entirely.</p>

<h2>Diets</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
<p>There are many different diet strategies that a person with type 1 diabetes can use to successfully manage their disease. A few of the more common ones are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diabetic Exchange diet. This is an older strategy that ensures the person has an appropriate number of calories and a healthy balance of foods every day. It works well for those who follow a consistent schedule, and ensures they eat an appropriate balance of healthy carbohydrates, fats, and proteins each day. However, it is very rigid and doesn't allow a person to eat less or more.</li>
<li>Carb Counting. This is the strategy most often taught to those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the last 20 years or so. An appropriate carb-to-insulin ratio is determined, which the person uses to calculate how much insulin they need to take to cover the carbohydrate content of the food they eat. To determine the carb counts of foods, people refers to nutrition labels, reference books or apps, or prior experience. They may use measuring cups or kitchen scales to ensure their measurements are accurate, especially for unfamiliar foods. The body also converts fat and protein to carbohydrates, so some people also track the fat and protein content of their foods, particularly if they follow an extremely low-carbohydrate (e.g., keto) or paleo diet.</li>
<li>Diets that reduce the amount of insulin needed per day. Insulin is life-saving. It is not something to be feared or avoided. However, by reducing the insulin required to cover food, there is less chance for measurement error and smaller consequence for any measurement error that does occur, avoiding the roller coaster blood sugars than can plague those with type 1 diabetes. Different diets achieve this reduction in insulin requirements in different ways. The keto diet involves eating very few carbohydrates in a day, which means very little insulin is needed to cover food. On the other hand, high-carb low-fat plant-based diets do this by increasing insulin sensitivity so less insulin is needed to cover a greater number of carbohydrates.</li>
<li>Sugar Surfing. This technique involves frequent blood sugar monitoring and correcting. It can be used with any of the other strategies. </li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there's a wide range of diet options available to a person with type 1 diabetes. The best option is the one that aligns with their other health concerns (e.g., Celiac disease and kidney disease are associated with type 1 diabetes), and their personal goals and lifestyle.</p>

<h3> Key Take-aways</h3>

<li>The best diet strategy for a person with type 1 diabetes depends on many factors. </li>
<li>Any change to the person's diet will require the person to do a lot of work to figure out appropriate dosing strategies.</li>

<h2>Challenges: Food Autonomy</h2>
</div>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
<p>One of the major challenges people with type 1 diabetes face is when others try to regulate their food. It can be frustrating and, if done in public, humiliating. In fact, people with the best management of their diabetes experience a lot of autonomy. Those who experience overprotective behaviour often do worse.</p>

<h3>Sarah and Gwen's story</h3>
<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> I attended a lunch function today and someone shared half their cupcake with me. Someone else told me, "You shouldn't be eating that! What am I going to do if you pass out?" It became a whole conversation about what I should and should not do. I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen:</strong> I think the issue some of us have is that if you don't defend yourself and explain that you have given insulin to cover what you eat, then it looks like you're a "bad" diabetic and you do what you want, leaving everyone else to deal with the consequences. We shouldn't care about what others think, but we do, especially when someone thinks we're killing ourselves.</p>

<h2>Challenges: Diabulimia and Disordered Eating</h2>
</div>
</div>

    <div class="col-sm-6">
<p>Unfortunately, a higher than normal proportion of those with type 1 diabetes develop eating disorders. Conservative estimates put the rate at about double the normal rate of eating disorders. The BBC documentary XXX claimed that 60% of all women with type 1 diabetes have experienced it. </p>

<h3>Tamyka's story</h3>
<p>It often feels like food is my enemy. I was diagnosed a long time ago, when type 1 diabetics were put on a pretty stringent eating regime. There's a reason they discovered an increase in young type 1 diabetic girls developing eating disorders. At the time, I remember setting up my meal plan with my dietitian and talking about "exchanges" (fats, proteins, or starches), and just wanting her permission (or anyone's!) to EAT food. I just felt like it was better to have fewer exchanges on my meal plan. I'm guessing that feeling came from the pressure to keep everything (sugars, weight, and therefore, food) LOWER.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
<p>One particular form of disordered eating unique to those with type 1 diabetes is called diabulimia. It involves not covering food with enough (or any) insulin. This means the body cannot use all the glucose it takes in  (in the form of food), and the kidneys do as much as they can to flush the unused glucose out in the urine. The person with diabetes loses weight, but experiences high blood glucose levels which can lead to DKA or diabetic complications.  </p>

<h3>Rachel's story</h3>
<p>I pretty much eat everything or nothing at all. I used to not take my short-acting insulin at all, or I'd make myself vomit so I could eat something but not need to take insulin for it. It's not something I talk about.

<h2>Did you get all that? </h2>
<p>Try a few questions</p>
Dave is at a Halloweeen party and sees his cousin Tim, who has type 1 diabetes and who had a scary hypoglycemic episode a month ago, grab a candy bar treat. Dave considers the following options. Which would be the best choice?
A. Quietly take the candy away from Tim and remind him of the hypoclycemic episode and the embarassment it had caused him.
B. Ask Tim if he was sure he wanted that since it has a lot of sugar.
C. Do nothing. Tim is an adult.
Feedback: Option C is best. Tim is an adult who is responsible for his own decisions. He is not making a healthy choice, but neither is anyone else eating treats at the party. As long as Time accurately tracks how many carbs he eats and gives an apporporate amount of insulin to cover it, hell be ok, from a blood sugar standpoint, Neither taking away Tim's treat nor second-guessin his decision would help Tim make better decisions in the future; instead, they would build resentment and create distance between Tim and Dave.
