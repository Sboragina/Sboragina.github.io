          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <!--p>
            Managing type 1 diabetes is all about numbers and measurements and
            preparing for the unexpected. It involves constant thought about:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The carbohydrate (and protein and fat) content of foods, and the
              corresponding insulin-to-carb (or fat or protein) ratios,
              correction factors
            </li>
            <li>
              The timing of insulin injections, whether because the person's on
              a strict insulin regimen or because they want to avoid blood sugar
              spikes when eating
            </li>
            <li>A1c results</li>
            <li>Time-in-range</li>
            <li>Others</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Following predictable routines can help, but it's a disease that
            keeps changing. And it can be exhausting to effectively analyze all
            the data that is generated.
          </p-->
          <p>
            Managing type 1 diabetes is all about numbers and measurements and
            timing and preparing for the unexpected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Managing type 1 diabetes is unique in that the patient doesn't
            simply follow the doctor's orders and take a prescribed amount of
            insulin every day until the doctor makes the next change. Instead,
            it is the person with type 1 diabetes who decides how much insulin
            (a drug that is both life-saving and deadly) to take every time they
            inject. And the appropriate dose depends on so many factors: what
            they plan to eat, how active they've been, if they're ill or taking
            other drugs like steroids, if they are stressed, etc. They follow
            guidelines provided by their health team, but the day-to-day
            decisions are theirs alone.
          </p>

          <h2>Mental Burden of Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
          <p>Living with type 1 diabetes can be</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>overwhelming:</strong> normal life activities have to be
              planned, and there are so many things to measure, record, and
              analyze.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>complex:</strong> many factors have to be considered even
              to determine an appropriate dose of insulin to take with a meal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>constant:</strong> a person with type 1 diabetes makes
              about 180 health-related decisions each day.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>unforgiving:</strong> the risk of complications never goes
              away, and bad things may happen despite the person's best efforts
              to manage the disease.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>uncertain:</strong> it's often unclear whether a symptom
              is related to diabetes or diabetic complications or another
              problem, and this uncertainty can breed worry and anxiety.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            People have different priorities. Achieving good clinical outcomes
            is not always at the top of the list. Some want good control over
            blood sugar levels to increase their lifespan and support better
            physical health; others want to be more free of the daily diabetes
            burden and choose to focus less meticulously on the daily
            management.

              "I had an overnight in the ICU after having DKA symptoms on and
              off for a few weeks. I tried to pull out of it, staying super
              hydrated, eating bananas, taking my multivitamins, checking my
              ketones, etc. Unfortunately, things out of my control like work
              and general life stressors kicked in, and I went into DKA. I got
              through the physical aspects of it OK. I mean, it wasn't pleasant,
              but I can tolerate a lot of physical pain by this point. The staff
              at the hospital were fantastic: they had positive attitudes and,
              most importantly, I felt like they listened to me and respected my
              knowledge of my body and this disease. But now I'm struggling with
              the mental and emotional feelings that come after:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The fear. Thinking about my mortality and all the what ifs. One
                of the doctors asked me if I had a DNR, and it freaked me out.
              </li>
              <li>
                The shame. I drove myself to the ER. I didn't want to bother
                anyone or be a burden or make them wait in that awful ER waiting
                room. I only told my boss because I was supposed to work the
                next day, and my roommates so they would feed my pets. I still
                haven't told my parents because I have felt so judged in the
                past. I don't want to tell my friends, either.
              </li>
              <li>The anger that I couldn't control it.</li>
              <li>The exhaustion.</li>

          <h3>Other people's responses</h3>
          <p>
            A big part of the emotional burden is dealing with the responses of
            others towards type 1 diabetes. Other people's negative or
            unexpected responses can make people with type 1 diabetes feel
            emotionally vulnerable, especially when the responses exhibit
            misconceptions and lack of understanding, particularly about the
            differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Confusing the two
            types of diabetes has a major emotional impact on those with type 1
            diabetes and causes feelings of frustration, anger, and a sense of
            not being understood or of being judged. Fortunately, meaningful
            relationships and good social support are stabilizing and help those
            with type 1 diabetes feel more in control<sup>1</sup>.

            <ul>
              <li>
                There is a lot of stigma around diabetes related to type 2
                diabetes and its connection with obesity. And that stigma can
                feel doubly unfair when it is directed towards those with type 1
                diabetes.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h2>Depression and Diabetes Distress<sup>1</sup></h2>
          <p>
            People with type 1 diabetes have a greater risk of developing
            depression than those without a chronic illness. But they're also
            likely to develop something similar: diabetes distress. Diabetes
            distress is related to depression, but is measured using different
            scales:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>emotional burden (similar to depression)</li>
            <li>regimen distress</li>
            <li>physician-related distress</li>
            <li>interpersonal distress</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Interestingly, when depression is detected and treated in a person
            with type 1 diabetes, their depression improves, but not their
            diabetes control. When diabetes distress is detected and treated,
            the distress improves and so does the diabetes control.
          </p>
          <h3>Diabetes Burnout</h3>
          <p>
            The day-to-day effort required to manage diabetes can be hard and
            frustrating, especially when the results don't match the effort the
            person is putting into managing the disease. At some stage, most
            people with type 1 diabetes experience worries, fear, and negative
            feelings. This can lead to diabetes burnout.
          </p>
          <p>
            Burnout is more than feeling a little down. It includes overwhelming
            feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. It is one of the major
            psychological complications of diabetes. Signs include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>not checking blood sugar levels</li>
            <li>stopping or reducing insulin injections</li>
            <li>not caring about eating habits or exercise</li>
            <li>trying to ignore or forget that they have diabetes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Ways you can help a person manage the emotional side of diabetes
            include the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Empathize with how difficult it can be to attempt to recreate a

                A person who is experiencing depression-like symptoms will

                chronic medical conditions so that both the non-diabetes issue

          <h2>Fear of Low Blood Sugars</h2>
          <p>
            Extreme low blood sugars are scary. They can even be fatal,
            especially if they occur at night while the person is asleep.
            Because experiencing low blood sugar is unpleasant and can be
            embarrassing if it happens in public, those with type 1 diabetes try
            to avoid it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Total avoidance is difficult, however. In one study, 36% of those
            with type 1 diabetes reported going into a coma due to low blood
            sugars at least once in their life. These extreme low blood sugars
            are often feared as much as diabetic complications. Some people with
            type 1 diabetes fear low blood sugars so much they deliberately keep
            their blood sugars higher than desirable, risking the long-term
            consequences of diabetic complications.

              we got back to the office, my sugar level was really low even
              though I had just eaten. I had one juice box, but needed more, and
              I started to lose control of my hands and couldn't get the next
              box open. I asked for some help with my juice box and my coworker
              called 911. Soon, there were 5 people in my cube plus paramedics
              and a stretcher to take me to the hospital. By this point, my
              blood sugar was back to normal, so I signed off to deny
              transportation to the hospital. But while all this was going on, I
              started crying and my muscles started jerking around and my
              co-workers got to see first-hand how horrid this disease is. My

          <h2>Diabulimia and Disordered Eating</h2>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, a higher than normal proportion of those with type 1
            diabetes develop eating disorders. Women with type 1 diabetes are
            two times more likely to have an eating disorder than woman without
            diabetes. Eating disorders occur in about 31-40% of women with type
            1 diabetes aged 15 to 30. In fact, the BBC documentary
            <a href="https://youtu.be/tSLjM6cZaTo" target="blank"
              >Diabulimia: The World's Most Dangerous Eating Disorder</a
            >
            claimed that 60% of all women with type 1 diabetes have experienced
            it.

              ago, when type 1 diabetics were put on a pretty stringent eating
              regime. There's a reason they discovered an increase in young type
              1 diabetic girls developing eating disorders. At the time, I
              remember setting up my meal plan with my dietitian and talking
              about "exchanges" (fats, proteins, or starches), and just wanting
              her permission (or anyone's!) to EAT food. I just felt like it was
              better to have fewer exchanges on my meal plan. I'm guessing that
              feeling came from the pressure to keep everything (sugars, weight,
              and therefore, food) LOWER."

            One particular form of disordered eating unique to those with type 1
            diabetes is called diabulimia. It involves not covering food with
            enough (or any) insulin. This means the body cannot use all the
            glucose it takes in (in the form of food), and the kidneys do as
            much as they can to flush the unused glucose out in the urine. The
            person with diabetes loses weight, but experiences high blood
            glucose levels which can lead to DKA or diabetic complications.

Always peeing and sweating. Only when I started taking the right amount of insulin for my food and carb counting properly did I put weight on. A downside is that once you've done it and realized how easy it is to lose weight, it's very tempting to go back there if you want to lose weight. It's something I've considered many, many times.

            <p>
              Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that has nothing to do
              with a person's appearance (and, by extension, diet or lifestyle
              choices). It is often an invisible disease, and a person with type
              1 diabetes may not look noticeably different from others.
