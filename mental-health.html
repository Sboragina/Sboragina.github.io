          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Managing type 1 diabetes is all about numbers and measurements and
            preparing for the unexpected. It involves constant thought about:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The carbohydrate (and protein and fat) content of foods, and the
              corresponding insulin-to-carb (or fat or protein) ratios,
              correction factors
            </li>
            <li>
              The timing of insulin injections, whether because the person's on
              a strict insulin regimen or because they want to avoid blood sugar
              spikes when eating
            </li>
            <li>A1c results</li>
            <li>Time-in-range</li>
            <li>Others</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Following predictable routines can help, but it's a disease that
            keeps changing. And it can be exhausting to effectively analyze all
            the data that is generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Type 1 diabetes is unique in that the patient doesn't simply follow
            the doctor's orders and take the prescribed amount of insulin every
            day until the doctor makes the next adjustment. It is the person
            with type 1 diabetes who decides how much insulin (a drug that is both
            life-saving and deadly) to take every time they inject. And the
            appropriate dose depends on so many factors: what they plan to eat,
            how active they've been, if they're ill or taking other drugs like
            steroids, if they are stressed, etc. Their decisions are guided by
            their health team, but the day-to-day decisions are theirs alone.
          </p>

          <h2>Mental Burden of Type 1 Diabetes</h2>
          <p>Living with type 1 diabetes can be</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              overwhelming: normal life activities have to be planned, and there
              are so many things to measure, record, and evaluate.
            </li>
            <li>
              complex: many factors have to be considered even to determine an
              appropriate dose of insulin to take with a meal.
            </li>
            <li>
              constant: it requires attention at least every few hours, regardless of what else is
              happening.
            </li>
            <li>
              unforgiving: the risk of complications never goes away, and
              complications or other bad things may happen despite the person
              trying hard to self-manage the disease.
            </li>
            <li>
              uncertain: it's often unclear whether a symptom is related to diabetes or diabetic complications or
              another problem, and this uncertainty can breed
              worry and anxiety.
            </li>

              "I had an overnight in the ICU after having DKA symptoms on and
              off for a few weeks. I tried to pull out of it, staying super
              hydrated, eating bananas, taking my multivitamins, checking my
              ketones, etc. Unfortunately, things out of my control like work
              and general life stressors really kicked in, and I went into DKA.
              I got through the physical aspects of it OK. I mean, it wasn't
              pleasant, but I can tolerate a lot of physical pain by this point.
              And the staff at the hospital were fantastic: they had positive
              attitudes, they were joking with me, and most importantly, I felt
              like they listened to me and respected my knowledge of my body and
              this disease. But now I'm really struggling with the mental and
              emotional tsunami that comes after:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The fear. Thinking about my mortality and all the what ifs. One
                of the doctors asked me if I had a DNR, and it really freaked me
                out. Not that I haven't thought about it, but being confronted
                with the question in real life made me question everything.
              </li>
              <li>
                The shame. I drove myself to the ER. I didn't want to bother
                anyone or be a burden or make them wait in that awful ER waiting
                room. I only told my boss because I was supposed to work the
                next day, and my roommates so they would feed my pets. I still
                haven't told my parents because I have felt so judged in the
                past. I don't want to tell my friends ... I'm not sure why.
              </li>
              <li>The anger that I couldn't control it.</li>
              <li>The exhaustion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I just want a body that functions properly."</p>

          <h2>Depression and Diabetes Distress<sup>1</sup></h2>
          <p>
            People with type 1 diabetes have a greater risk of developing
            depression than those without a chronic illness. But they're also
            likely to develop something similar: diabetes distress. Diabetes
            distress is related to depression, but is measured using different
            scales:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>emotional burden (similar to depression)</li>
            <li>regimen distress</li>
            <li>physician-related distress</li>
            <li>interpersonal distress</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Interestingly, when depression is detected and treated in a person
            with type 1 diabetes, their depression improves, but not their
            diabetes control. When diabetes distress is detected and treated,
            the distress improves and so does the diabetes control.
          </p>
          <h3>Diabetes Burnout</h3>
          <p>
            The day-to-day effort required to manage diabetes can be hard and
            frustrating, especially when the results don't match the effort the
            person is putting into managing the disease. At some stage, most
            people with type 1 diabetes experience worries, fear, and negative
            feelings. This can lead to diabetes burnout.
          </p>
          <p>
            Burnout is more than feeling a little down. It includes overwhelming
            feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. It is one of the major
            psychological complications of diabetes. Signs include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>not checking blood sugar levels</li>
            <li>stopping or reducing insulin injections</li>
            <li>not caring about eating habits or exercise</li>
            <li>trying to ignore or forget that they have diabetes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Ways for managing the emotional side of diabetes include the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Rewarding good behaviours, like checking blood sugar levels more
              often, regardless of what number shows up on the meter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Talking about blood sugar numbers as "high" and "low" and NOT
              "good" or "bad", and framing these numbers as information to be
              used rather than as reflections on the person.

          <p>
            Unfortunately, a higher than normal proportion of those with type 1
            diabetes develop eating disorders. Conservative estimates put the
            rate at about double the normal rate of eating disorders. The BBC
            documentary XXX claimed that 60% of all women with type 1 diabetes
            have experienced it.

              ago, when type 1 diabetics were put on a pretty stringent eating
              regime. There's a reason they discovered an increase in young type
              1 diabetic girls developing eating disorders. At the time, I
              remember setting up my meal plan with my dietitian and talking
              about "exchanges" (fats, proteins, or starches), and just wanting
              her permission (or anyone's!) to EAT food. I just felt like it was
              better to have fewer exchanges on my meal plan. I'm guessing that
              feeling came from the pressure to keep everything (sugars, weight,
              and therefore, food) LOWER."

            One particular form of disordered eating unique to those with type 1
            diabetes is called diabulimia. It involves not covering food with
            enough (or any) insulin. This means the body cannot use all the
            glucose it takes in (in the form of food), and the kidneys do as
            much as they can to flush the unused glucose out in the urine. The
            person with diabetes loses weight, but experiences high blood
            glucose levels which can lead to DKA or diabetic complications.

              Dave is at a Halloween party with his cousin Tim. Tim has type 1
              diabetes, and he had a scary hypoglycemic episode about a month
              ago. Dave sees Tim grab a candy bar treat. Dave considers the
              following options. Which would be the best choice?

            <div class="radio">
              <label for="dave-take">
                <input

                  value="a"
                />
                a. Quietly take the candy away from Tim and remind him of the
                hypoglycemic episode and the embarassment it had caused him.

                b. Ask Tim if he is sure he wants that &mdash; it has a lot of
                sugar.

                c. Do nothing. Tim is an adult.

                <strong>Correct!</strong> Option C is best. Tim is an adult who
                is responsible for his own decisions. He is not making a healthy
                choice, but neither is anyone else eating treats at the party.
                As long as Tim accurately tracks how many carbs he eats and
                gives an appropriate amount of insulin to cover it, he'll be ok,
                from a blood sugar standpoint. Neither taking away Tim's treat
                nor second-guessing his decision would help Tim achieve better
                control over his blood sugars; instead, these actions would
                build resentment and create distance between Tim and Dave.
