<p>I'm going to quickly demonstrate the steps involved in counting carbohydrates.
I count carbohydrates to determine how much insulin to take to cover my food. It's a lot of math!</p>
<p>Here's how it works.</p>
<p>First, I plan what I'm going to eat:</p> 
<ul>
<li>two slices of toast,</li> 
<li>a bowl of oatmeal, and </li>
<li>a banana.</li>
</ul>
<p>I measure out my food. If the foods are ones I eat often, I likely already know what a serving size looks like and the corresponding carb count.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutrition facts for bread: 2 slices is 25 g of carbohydrates</li>
<li>Nutrition facts for oatmeal: one-half cup oatmeal is 33 g of carbohydrates</li>
<li>Food scale for banana: 29.43 g of carbohydrates</li>
</ul>
<p>I calculate the total number of carbohydrates in the food. </p>
<p>Total carbohydrates: 87 g</p>
<p>I use my insulin-to-carb ratio to determine how many units of insulin I will need. An app or the bolus calculator on my insulin pump can help.</p>
<p>For an insulin-to-carb ratio of 1-to-15, that 87 g of carbohydrates requires 5.8 units of insulin.</p>
<p>If I'm feeling really disciplined, I wait about 15 minutes before I start eating my food so the insulin has time to travel to my bloodstream before I eat my food. I need to make sure I don't forget to eat and that nobody steals my food!</p>
