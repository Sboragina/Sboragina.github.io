      <h2>What can a person with type 1 diabetes eat?</h2>
      <p>The short answer is ... anything!</p>
      <p>You are likely familiar with the diet advice given to type 2 diabetics: eat healthy foods that promote weight loss. Weight loss reduces insulin resistance, and reducing insulin resistance can cure type 2 diabetes. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, weight loss does NOT cure type 1 diabetes. </p>
      <p>There is no diet, supplement, spice, essential oil, or other "natural" treatment that can cure type 1 diabetes.<sup>1</sup> Some diets and supplements can reduce insulin resistance, but a person with type 1 diabetes would still need to take insulin, just less of it.</p>

        <p>"It really bothers me when others tell me I could get off insulin if I changed my diet. I can't get off insulin! Even if I only drink water and eat no carbohydrates, I'll still need to inject insulin to live. My pancreas doesn't produce insulin!"</p>

      <p>The primary goal for those with type 1 diabetes is achieving stable, normal-range blood glucose levels. Matching food intake to insulin dosages is critical. Eating a healthy diet that minimizes the risk for heart disease (a leading cause of death for persons with diabetes) is also important.</p>
      <div class="recap">
        <h3>Key Take-aways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>NO diet will eliminate the person's need for insulin.</li>
            <li>The primary goal of a person with type 1 diabetes is to take the amount of insulin that will correctly cover the food eaten.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>But what about sugar?</h2>
      <p>People often think those with type 1 diabetes can't have sugar. This isn't true. While it's not healthy, it doesn't need to be avoided entirely.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">
        <p>As we saw in <a href="">SECTION 1</a>, the body breaks down all carbohydrates we consume into glucose (sugar). The appropriate dose of insulin to cover the carbohydrates is the same no matter what form the carbohydrates have initially (although the timing of the dose depends on whether they are simple or complex).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p>Illustration: 20 g of carbohydrates from mashed potatoes -&gt; 20 g of glucose; 20 g of carbohydrates from a candy bar -&gt; 20 g of glucose</p>

    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p>To be fair, sugar is not good for anyone. It's processed, and it quickly spikes blood sugar levels. Twenty years ago or more, diets prescribed for those with type 1 diabetes (e.g., the diabetic exchange diet) did not permit sugar. However, that approach was largely abandoned because some of those with type 1 diabetes (especially children) developed unhealthy eating habits as a result. They didn't learn to eat to match hunger levels; and many sneaked treats (read about diabulimia and disordered eating in the section on <a href="">Mental Health</a>). People who develop type 1 diabetes can live with this disease for 70 years or more, so a long-term view is generally better. Forcing those with type 1 diabetes to restrict their diet (e.g., avoid sugar) corresponds with them doing more poorly at managing their diabetes. So, if you see a person with type 1 diabetes eating a sugary treat, either leave them alone or subject everyone in the room to the same scolding about the dangers of sugar; don't single out the person with diabetes.</p>

            <p>I once went out for a drink with friends. I had a skittle cocktail and my friend's friend put her hand in my drink, grabbed a bunch of skittles out of the bottom of my drink, dumped them in her drink, and then told me I shouldn't be eating sugar. I was so angry and disgusted!</p>

      <p>You've probably seen "diabetic candy" sold at a pharmacy or grocery store. This candy is typically not free from carbohydrates &mdash; it's free from sugar; in addition, it often contains sugar alcohols, which may affect blood glucose levels in those with type 1 diabetes and can cause gastrointestinal issues. Despite the marketing, these candies are best avoided entirely.</p>
      <div class="recap">
        <h3>Key Take-aways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>All carbs turn into sugar.</li>
          <li>Don't buy "diabetic" treats.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Diets</h2>
      <p>There are many different diet strategies that a person with type 1 diabetes can use to successfully manage their disease. A few of the more common ones are described below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diabetic Exchange diet. This is an older strategy that ensures the person has an appropriate number of calories and a healthy balance of foods every day. It works well for those who follow a consistent schedule, and ensures they eat an appropriate balance of healthy carbohydrates, fats, and proteins each day. However, it is very rigid and doesn't allow a person to eat less or more.</li>
        <li>Carb Counting. This is the strategy most often taught to those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the last 20 years or so. An appropriate carb-to-insulin ratio is determined, which the person uses to calculate how much insulin they need to take to cover the carbohydrate content of the food they eat. To determine the carb counts of foods, people refers to nutrition labels, reference books or apps, or prior experience. They may use measuring cups or kitchen scales to ensure their measurements are accurate, especially for unfamiliar foods. The body also converts fat and protein to carbohydrates, so some people also track the fat and protein content of their foods, particularly if they follow an extremely low-carbohydrate (e.g., keto) or paleo diet.</li>
        <li>Diets that reduce the amount of insulin needed per day. Insulin is life-saving. It is not something to be feared or avoided. However, by reducing the insulin required to cover food, there is less chance for measurement error and smaller consequence for any measurement error that does occur, avoiding the roller coaster blood sugars than can plague those with type 1 diabetes. Different diets achieve this reduction in insulin requirements in different ways. The keto diet involves eating very few carbohydrates in a day, which means very little insulin is needed to cover food. On the other hand, high-carb low-fat plant-based diets do this by increasing insulin sensitivity so less insulin is needed to cover a greater number of carbohydrates.</li>
        <li>Sugar Surfing. This technique involves frequent blood sugar monitoring and correcting. It can be used with any of the other strategies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As you can see, there's a wide range of diet options available to a person with type 1 diabetes. The best option is the one that aligns with their other health concerns (e.g., Celiac disease and kidney disease are associated with type 1 diabetes), and their personal goals and lifestyle.</p>
      <div class="recap">
        <h3>Key Take-aways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The best diet strategy for a person with type 1 diabetes depends on many factors.</li>
          <li>Any change to the person's diet will require the person to do a lot of work to figure out appropriate dosing strategies.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Eating out</h2>
      <p>text</p>
      <h2>Challenges: Food Autonomy</h2>
      <p>One of the major challenges people with type 1 diabetes face is when others try to regulate their food. It can be frustrating and, if done in public, humiliating. In fact, people with the best management of their diabetes experience a lot of autonomy. Those who experience overprotective behaviour often do worse.</p>

          <p><span class="fa fa-check"></span> <strong>Correct!</strong> Option C is best. Tim is an adult who is responsible for his own decisions. He is not making a healthy choice, but neither is anyone else eating treats at the party. As long as Tim accurately tracks how many carbs he eats and gives an appropriate amount of insulin to cover it, he'll be ok, from a blood sugar standpoint. Neither taking away Tim's treat nor second-guessing his decision would help Tim achieve better control over his blood sugars; instead, these actions would build resentment and create distance between Tim and Dave.</p>
