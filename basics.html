        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Diabetes is one of the most talked about diseases in North America.
          Again and again we hear about how obesity and lifestyle choices are
          major risk factors for developing diabetes &mdash; except this isn't
          quite true &mdash; they are major risk factor for developing
          <strong>type 2</strong> diabetes. The causes of other types of
          diabetes have nothing to do with obesity or lifestyle choices. And
          these other types of diabetes are rarely mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this module, we'll look at Type 1 diabetes. Start by watching
          this short introduction by actor Victor Garber, who was diagnosed
          with type 1 diabetes in 1962 when he was 11 years old.

        <h2>Diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          Diabetes is a group of diseases that result in high blood glucose
          (sugar) levels. Cells in the body need glucose to function. Insulin,
          a hormone produced in the pancreas, lets the glucose enter the
          cells. In a person with diabetes, either not enough insulin is
          produced or the insulin does not work very well (this is called
          insulin resistance).
        </p>
        <p>
          Approximately 90% of those with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. The
          rest have type 1 diabetes or diabetes due to other causes that also affect the person's ability to digest food,
          sometimes called
          <a href="https://www.unitypoint.org/livewell/article.aspx?id=c384879f-cfd0-42c8-b743-a1333cf09f47"
            target="blank">type 3c diabetes</a>. These other types of diabetes are not caused by a person's
          activity level, weight, or age.
        </p>
        <h2>Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          You probably already know a lot about type 2 diabetes. This is the
          "diabetes" shown on television ads and in most medical pamphlets.
          Sometimes the information from these sources can be a bit
          misleading, though. For example, there are many subtypes of type 2
          diabetes, and some of them have little connection to obesity and
          lifestyle choices, either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Type 2 diabetes occurs when a person's pancreas can't produce enough
          insulin. In fact, their pancreas may be producing much more insulin
          than a person without diabetes needs, but their body is not able to
          use the insulin properly. Not being able to use insulin properly is
          called insulin resistance. Belly fat is a source of insulin
          resistance, which is why losing weight can reverse type 2 diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
          As type 2 diabetes progresses, the high blood sugars damage the
          pancreas's ability to produce insulin. So, a person with type 2
          diabetes may need to take insulin even if they are able to lower
          their insulin resistance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Type 2 diabetes typically develops gradually. The first step in
          managing it is usually through diet changes to help the person lose
          fat tissue. The person may be prescribed pills or injectable
          medications that lower insulin resistance and hopefully enable the
          body to effectively use the insulin the pancreas produces. The final
          step is to prescribe insulin, to supplement what the pancreas
          produces.

          <h3>Key Take-aways</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There are many different kinds of diabetes, but the comments and
              concerns we hear about "diabetes" usually refer to type 2
              diabetes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sometimes, type 2 diabetes is due to lifestyle choices such as
              obesity and inactivity.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Type 1 Diabetes: An Autoimmune Disease</h2>
        <p>
          Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. In autoimmune diseases,
          the body's immune system mistakenly identifies a healthy part of the
          body as a foreign invader and destroys it! In the case of type 1
          diabetes, the body attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells
          in the pancreas.

        </p>

        <p>
          Autoimmune diseases have a genetic component and an environmental
          trigger.
        </p>
        <p>
          For type 1 diabetes, the autoimmune attack is gradual. Usually, it
          takes several years for it to progress from antibodies in the
          bloodstream to elevated blood sugars. However, once blood sugars
          begin to elevate, it's important to act fast! The person can go into
          diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) quickly. And DKA can be deadly (we'll
          talk more about DKA in Section
          <a href="blood-levels.html" target="_self">5. High and Low Blood Sugars</a>) In fact, the speed of the disease
          progression is one sign that a
          person has type 1 diabetes and not type 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed at any age after about 6 months.
          The younger a person is when diagnosed, the stronger and faster the
          autoimmune attack tends to be. The most common age for people to be
          diagnosed with type 1 diabetes is around 14 years old.

        <p>
          Type 1 diabetes used to be called "juvenile diabetes" because it is
          often diagnosed in childhood. However, the disease is chronic. It
          doesn't go away. It doesn't get easier. It doesn't change into a
          different form of diabetes. Although a person may be diagnosed with
          type 1 diabetes as a child, they live most of their lives with the
          disease as an adult.
        </p>
        <p>
          A challenge those who develop the disease as adults face is getting
          the correct diagnosis. Those diagnosed as adults often have a
          slower-progressing form of the disease called
          <a href="https://beyondtype1.org/what-is-lada-diabetes/" target="blank">latent autoimmune diabetes in adults
            (LADA)</a>
          A study in Great Britain found that approximately one-third of those
          who develop type 1 diabetes as adults aged 30 or older are initially
          misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes. They are often initially
          treated only with medications that lower insulin resistance. Half of
          those who were misdiagnosed were still misdiagnosed 13 years
          later<sup>5</sup>. These misdiagnoses can result in years of high
          blood sugars and damage that leads to unnecessary diabetic
          complications.
        </p>

        <div class="recap">
          <h3>Key Take-aways</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means it has a
              genetic component and an environmental trigger.
            </li>
            <li>
              Type 1 diabetes can affect anyone, no matter how healthy they
              are or how old they are.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Who is at risk of developing Type 1 Diabetes?</h2>

        <p>
          Type 1 diabetes is rare. The risk of developing type 1 diabetes is
          about 0.3%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall that autoimmune diseases have a genetic component and an
          environmental trigger. A person with the genes associated with type
          1 diabetes has less than a 10% chance of actually developing the
          disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          In type 1 diabetes, the genetic component is a marker on chromosome
          6. The markers associated with type 1 diabetes are more common among
          Caucasians than those of African, Chinese, or South American
          descent.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          We think the trigger is often a viral illness. Viruses that may
          trigger type 1 diabetes include German measles, coxsackie, and
          mumps. People are more likely to contract viral illnesses when it's
          cold outside. Data show that those who live in northern climates are
          more likely to develop type 1 diabetes than those who live in
          southern climates, and more cases of type 1 diabetes are diagnosed
          in winter than in summer.

        <h3>Family History of Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
        <p>
          A person is more likely to develop type 1 diabetes if there is a
          family history of type 1 diabetes. A study of children diagnosed
          with type 1 diabetes found about 30% had someone with type 1
          diabetes in their extended family<sup>2</sup>. Data for the US show
          that about 0.3% of the population has type 1 diabetes, but those
          with a first-degree relative have about a 5% risk of developing
          it<sup>3</sup>.
        </p>
        <!--p>
            Here are some data about the risks of developing type 1 diabetes if
            an immediate family member has it<sup>4</sup>.
          </p>
          <p>A person's risk of developing type 1 diabetes is</p>
          <ul>
            <li>about 6% if the person's father has it;</li>
            <li>
              about 4% if the person's mather has it AND gave birth to the
              person before age 25;
            </li>
            <li>
              about 1% if the person's mather has it AND gave birth to the
              person at age 25 or older;
            </li>
            <li>
              as high as 25% if both parents were diagnosed with it before the
              age of 11;
            </li>
            <li>
              about 50% if a parent also has a condition called type 2
              polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (about 14% of people with type 1
              diabetes have this syndrome);
            </li>
            <li>about 5% if a sibling has it, but neither parent has it; or</li>
            <li>about 50% if an identical twin has it.</li>
          </ul-->
        <h3>Family history of autoimmune diseases</h3>

        <p>
          Autoimmune diseases tend to cluster, both in individuals and in
          families. Type 1 diabetes is not common, and many people with type 1
          diabetes are the only ones in their family with the disease.
          However, their family members often have other autoimmune diseases.
          A study of children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes found about 22%
          had an immediate family member with an autoimmune disease (vs. 12.9%
          in those without type 1 diabetes) and 72% had someone with an
          autoimmune disease in their extended family (vs. 62% in those
          without type 1 diabetes)<sup>2</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Autoimmune diseases that may be present in family members of those
          with type 1 diabetes include the following:<sup>5</sup>

          You’re waiting at a bus stop with Joshua, who is 55 years old and
          about 50 pounds (about 23 kg) overweight. As you chat, you learn his family doctor
          recently diagnosed him with diabetes based on bloodwork done at his
          last physical. He has started on Metformin (pills), but they don’t
          seem to be helping his blood sugar levels much, and he’s really
          tired, so he doesn’t exercise much. He’s also been busy lately
          helping out his sister, who has lupus.

                his blood sugars seem to need more help than his current dose
                of Metformin is offering.

                <strong>Correct!</strong> Option B is better. Joshua does have
                a lot of risk factors related to type 2 diabetes. However,
                since he also has the family history of autoimmune disease
                (i.e., lupus), it is not unreasonable for him to request
                additional testing to confirm there are no antibodies present.
                Type 1 diabetes would need to be managed more aggressively,
                and it could take years for him and his doctors to sort out a
                misdiagnosis. In the meantime, his health could suffer and he
                might develop diabetic complications.
