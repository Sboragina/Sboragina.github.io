          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Some of the most common responses heard when a person shares that
            they have type 1 diabetes are related to food. Many of these
            responses are based on misinformation or relate to type 2 diabetes.
            Let's take a look at a few common responses.
          </p>
          <h2>What can a person with type 1 diabetes eat?</h2>
          <p>The short answer is ... anything!</p>
          <p>
            You are likely familiar with the diet advice given to type 2
            diabetics: eat healthy foods that promote weight loss. Weight loss
            reduces insulin resistance, and reducing insulin resistance can cure
            type 2 diabetes.
          </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, weight loss does NOT cure type 1 diabetes.</p>
          <p>
            There is no diet, supplement, spice, essential oil, or other
            "natural" treatment that can cure type 1 diabetes.<sup>1</sup> Some
            diets and supplements can reduce insulin resistance, but a person
            with type 1 diabetes who reduces their insulin resistance still
            needs insulin, just less of it.

              if I changed my diet. I can't get off insulin! Even if I only
              drink water and eat no carbohydrates, I still need to inject
              insulin to live. My pancreas doesn't produce insulin!"

            The primary goal for those with type 1 diabetes is achieving stable,
            normal-range blood glucose levels. Matching food intake to insulin
            dosages is critical. Eating a healthy diet that minimizes the risk
            for heart disease (a leading cause of death for those with diabetes)
            is also important.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a wide range of diet options available to a person with
            type 1 diabetes. The best option is the one that aligns with the
            person's other health concerns (e.g., Celiac disease and kidney
            disease are fairly common among those with type 1 diabetes) and
            their personal goals and lifestyle.

                The primary goal of a person with type 1 diabetes is to take the

              <li>
                The best diet strategy for a person with type 1 diabetes depends
                on many factors.

          <h2>How do they know how much insulin to take?</h2>
          <p>
            A person with type 1 diabetes has to think about how much insulin
            they should take for every bit of food they eat. Even if they take a
            fixed amount of insulin at the same time each day, they still have
            to make sure to EAT the appropriate amount of food to match that
            insulin dose.
          </p>
          <p>So, how do they do it?</p>
          <p>Two common strategies are described below.</p>
          <h3>Diabetic Exchange diet</h3>
          <p>
            The diabetic exchange diet is an older strategy. It works well for
            those who follow a consistent schedule. It ensures the person eats
            an appropriate balance of healthy carbohydrates, fats, and proteins
            each day.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is very rigid. The person must inject insulin at the same time
            each day. The food they eat has the same balance of carbohydrates,
            fats, and proteins from one day to the next &mdash; the person
            cannot eat less or more depending on how hungry they feel.
          </p>
          <h3>Carb Counting</h3>
          <p>
            This strategy is what most of those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes
            in the last 20 years or so have been taught. It is a flexible
            strategy that allows people to eat the foods they want to eat when
            they want to eat them. It allows those with type 1 diabetes to eat
            the same foods as their peers and their families or to follow other
            diets (e.g., autoimmune protocol, keto diet, whole foods diet).

            <a href="basics.html" target="_self">Type 1 Diabetes: The Basics</a
            >, the body breaks down all carbohydrates ("carbs") we consume into
            glucose. The appropriate dose of insulin to cover the carbohydrates
            is the same no matter what form the carbohydrates have initially
            (although how fast the carbohydrates are digested depends on whether
            they are simple or complex).

            People who count carbohydrates use an insulin-to-carb ratio to
            determine how much insulin to take to cover a meal depending on the
            number of carbohydrates they plan to eat.

            The body also converts fat and protein to carbohydrates, so some
            people with type 1 diabetes also count the fat and protein content
            of their foods, particularly if they follow an extremely
            low-carbohydrate diet (e.g., keto).

            <ul>
              <li>
                Carb counting is a strategy that people with type 1 diabetes can
                use to calculate how much insulin to take with a meal.
              </li>
              <li>
                When a person with type 1 diabetes makes a significant change to
                their diet (e.g., adopting a keto diet), the person will need to
                learn new ways of determining appropriate insulin dosages. This
                can be very challenging.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h2>Why is the timing of the insulin injection important?</h2>
          <p>
            There are two major decisions a person with type 1 diabetes must
            make when eating:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>deciding HOW MUCH insulin to take, and</li>
            <li>deciding WHEN to take it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When a person eats, the food is digested and converted to glucose.
            When the body of a person without diabetes senses extra glucose in
            the bloodstream, it immediately sends insulin to move the glucose
            out of the blood and into the cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person with type 1 diabetes injects insulin into fat tissue.
            Modern rapid-acting insulins (see more about insulins in
            <a href="devices.html" target="_self">Medications and Devices</a>)
            take about 15 minutes to start acting &mdash; it's not immediate.
            Meanwhile, the carbohydrates in the food may be digested and
            converted to glucose quickly or slowly. Timing the insulin injection
            so that the insulin starts to act at the same time blood glucose
            levels start to rise is challenging.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Most people with type 1 diabetes respond to this challenge using
            routines and preparation. A common strategy is to inject insulin
            about 15 minutes before eating. However, certain situations make
            this strategy hard to apply:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              when the amount of carbohydrate in the food is unknown (e.g., the
              food was prepared by someone else)
            </li>
            <li>when the amount of food that will be eaten is unknown</li>
            <li>when the time the food will be served is unknown</li>

          <h2>What about sugar?</h2>
          <p>
            People often think those with type 1 diabetes can't have sugar. This
            isn't true. While it's not healthy, it doesn't need to be avoided
            entirely.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sugar is not good for anyone. It's processed, and it quickly spikes
            blood sugar levels. And, twenty years ago or more, diets prescribed
            for those with type 1 diabetes (e.g., the diabetic exchange diet)
            did not permit sugar. However, that approach was largely abandoned
            because some of those with type 1 diabetes (especially children)
            developed unhealthy eating habits as a result. They didn't learn to
            eat to match hunger levels; many sneaked treats (read about the
            relationship between type 1 diabetes and disordered eating in the
            section on
            <a href="mental-health.html" target="_self">Mental Health</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            People who develop type 1 diabetes can live with this disease for 70
            years or more, so a long-term view is generally better. Forcing
            those with type 1 diabetes to restrict their diet (e.g., avoid
            sugar) actually corresponds with them being less effective at
            self-managing their diabetes. So, if you see a person with type 1
            diabetes eating a sugary treat, either leave them alone or subject
            everyone in the room to the same scolding about the dangers of
            sugar; don't single out the person with diabetes.

          <h3>Isn't diabetic candy better?</h3>
          <p>
            You've probably seen "diabetic candy" sold at a pharmacy or grocery
            store. This candy is typically not free from carbohydrates &mdash;
            it's free from sugar; in addition, it often contains sugar alcohols,
            which may affect blood glucose levels in those with type 1 diabetes
            and can cause gastrointestinal issues. Despite the marketing, these
            candies are best avoided entirely.
          </p>
          <h3>Why autonomy is important</h3>
          <p>
            One of the major challenges people with type 1 diabetes face is when
            others try to regulate their food. It can be frustrating and, if
            done in public, humiliating.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with type 1 diabetes who feel free to make their own
            decisions and who feel supported even when they make the wrong
            decisions tend to do better at managing their disease. They feel
            better emotionally, too. Those who experience blame or
            overprotective behaviours from others are less likely to monitor
            their blood sugars or adjust their insulin doses, and are more
            likely to binge eat.<sup>2</sup>

                <strong>Correct!</strong> Option C is best. Tim is an adult who
                is responsible for his own decisions. He is not making a healthy
                choice, but neither is anyone else eating treats at the party.
                As long as Tim accurately tracks how many carbs he eats and
                gives an appropriate amount of insulin to cover it, he'll be ok,
                from a blood sugar standpoint. Neither taking away Tim's treat
                nor second-guessing his decision would help Tim achieve better
                control over his blood sugars; instead, these actions would
                build resentment and create distance between Tim and Dave.
