      <h2>What can a person with type 1 diabetes eat?</h2>
      <p>The short answer is ... anything!</p>
      <p>You are likely familiar with the diet advice given to type 2 diabetics: eat healthy foods that promote weight loss. Weight loss reduces insulin resistance, and reducing insulin resistance can cure type 2 diabetes. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, weight loss does NOT cure type 1 diabetes. </p>
      <p>There is no diet, supplement, spice, essential oil, or other "natural" treatment that can cure type 1 diabetes.<sup>1</sup> Some diets and supplements can reduce insulin resistance, but a person with type 1 diabetes who reduces their insulin resistance still needs insulin, just less of it.</p>

        <p>"It really bothers me when others tell me I could get off insulin if I changed my diet. I can't get off insulin! Even if I only drink water and eat no carbohydrates, I still need to inject insulin to live. My pancreas doesn't produce insulin!"</p>

      <p>The primary goal for those with type 1 diabetes is achieving stable, normal-range blood glucose levels. Matching food intake to insulin dosages is critical. Eating a healthy diet that minimizes the risk for heart disease (a leading cause of death for those with diabetes) is also important.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>NO diet will eliminate a person's need for insulin.</li>
            <li>The primary goal of a person with type 1 diabetes is to take the amount of insulin that will correctly cover the food they eat.</li>

      <h2>Diets</h2>
      <p>There are many different diet strategies that a person with type 1 diabetes can use to successfully manage their disease. A few of the more common ones are described below.</p>
      <h3>Diabetic Exchange diet</h3>
<p>The diabetic exchange diet is an older diet strategy. It works well for those who follow a consistent schedule and ensures they eat an appropriate balance of healthy carbohydrates, fats, and proteins each day. It requires eating and giving the same amount of insulin at the same time each day. it is very rigid and doesn't allow a person to eat less or more.</p>
        <h3>Carb Counting</h3> 
<p>This strategy is what most of those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the last 20 years or so have been taught. It is a flexible strategy that allows people to eat the foods they want to eat and that their family and peers are eating. It can be used together with other diet strategies.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">
        <p>As we saw in the section <a href="">What is Type 1 Diabetes?</a>, the body breaks down all carbohydrates ("carbs") we consume into glucose. The appropriate dose of insulin to cover the carbohydrates is the same no matter what form the carbohydrates have initially (although how fast the carbohydrates are digested depends on whether they are simple or complex). </p>
<p>People who count carbohydrates use an insulin-to-carb ratio to determine how much insulin to take to cover a meal depending on the number of carbohydrates they plan to eat. Watch the following video for a quick overview.</p>

<p>The body also converts fat and protein to carbohydrates, so some people also count the fat and protein content of their foods, particularly if they follow an extremely low-carbohydrate diet (e.g., keto) or the paleo diet. </p>
<h3>Diets that reduce the amount of insulin needed per day</h3>
Insulin is life-saving. It is not something to be avoided. However, by reducing the insulin required to cover food, there is less chance for measurement error when counting carbohydrates and any measurement error that does occur has less of an impact, avoiding the roller coaster blood sugars than can plague those with type 1 diabetes. </p>
<p>Different diets lower the amount of insulin a person needs in different ways:
<ul>
<li> The keto diet involves eating very few carbohydrates in a day, which means very little insulin is needed to cover the carbohydrates in food. </li>
<li>High-carbohydrate low-fat plant-based diets increase insulin sensitivity so less insulin is needed to cover a greater number of carbohydrates.</li>
</ul>
        <h3>Sugar Surfing</h3>
<p>This technique involves frequent blood sugar monitoring and correcting. It can be used with any of the other strategies.</p>
<hr />
      <p>As you can see, there are a wide range of diet options available to a person with type 1 diabetes. The best option is the one that aligns with the person's other health concerns (e.g., Celiac disease and kidney disease are fairly common among those with type 1 diabetes) and their personal goals and lifestyle.</p>
      <div class="recap">
        <h3>Key Take-aways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The best diet strategy for a person with type 1 diabetes depends on many factors.</li>
          <li>Any change to the person's diet will require the person to do a lot of work to figure out appropriate dosing strategies.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Timing Insulin Action with Food</h2>
      <p>There are two major decisions a person with type 1 diabetes must make when eating:</p>
<ul>
<li>deciding HOW MUCH insulin to take, and </li>
<li>deciding WHEN to take it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a person eats, the food is digested and converted to glucose. When the body of a person without diabetes senses extra glucose in the bloodstream, it immediately sends insulin to move the glucose out of the blood and into the cells. </p>
<p>A person with type 1 diabetes injects insulin into fat tissue. Modern rapid-acting insulins (see more about insulins in <a href="">Medications and Devices</a>) take about 15 minutes to start acting &mdash; it's not immediate. Meanwhile, the carbohydrates in the food may be digested and converted to glucose quickly or slowly. Timing the insulin injection so that the insulin starts to act at the same time blood glucose levels start to rise is challenging.<p>
<p>Most people with type 1 diabetes respond to this challenge using routines and preparation. A common strategy is to inject insulin about 15 minutes before eating. However, certain situations make this strategy hard to apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the amount of carbohydrates in the food is unknown (e.g., the food was prepared by someone else)</li>
<li>when the amount of food that will be eaten is unknown </li>
<li>when the time the food will be served is unknown</li>
</ul>

    <div class="row align-middle">

      <div class="col-sm-9">
        <p>"I struggle with Holiday meals. There is pressure to eat in time with others, but the time the food is served and the carb count is not predictable. Usually I try to watch my continuous glucose monitor to see what my blood sugar is doing before the meal and prepare as best I can. I often do end up forgoing most of the carb-laden stuff and stick with turkey and simple veggie choices. Although there's always that host who encourages me to fill my plate. I'm happy when they understand!"</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
<div class="recap">
        <h3>Key Take-aways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Determining the appropriate amount of insulin to take is only half the challenge. </li>
<li>Determining when to take the insulin so that the insulin action matches how quickly the digestive system breaks down the carbohydrates into glucose is the other half of the challenge.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
<h2>But what about sugar?</h2>
      <p>People often think those with type 1 diabetes can't have sugar. This isn't true. While it's not healthy, it doesn't need to be avoided entirely.</p>


      <p>Sugar is not good for anyone. It's processed, and it quickly spikes blood sugar levels. And, twenty years ago or more, diets prescribed for those with type 1 diabetes (e.g., the diabetic exchange diet) did not permit sugar. However, that approach was largely abandoned because some of those with type 1 diabetes (especially children) developed unhealthy eating habits as a result. They didn't learn to eat to match hunger levels; many sneaked treats (read about the relationship between type 1 diabetes and disordered eating in the section on <a href="">Mental Health</a>). </p>
<p>People who develop type 1 diabetes can live with this disease for 70 years or more, so a long-term view is generally better. Forcing those with type 1 diabetes to restrict their diet (e.g., avoid sugar) actually corresponds with them being less effective self-managing their diabetes. So, if you see a person with type 1 diabetes eating a sugary treat, either leave them alone or subject everyone in the room to the same scolding about the dangers of sugar; don't single out the person with diabetes.</p>

<h3>Isn't diabetic candy better?</h3>
      <p>You've probably seen "diabetic candy" sold at a pharmacy or grocery store. This candy is typically not free from carbohydrates &mdash; it's free from sugar; in addition, it often contains sugar alcohols, which may affect blood glucose levels in those with type 1 diabetes and can cause gastrointestinal issues. Despite the marketing, these candies are best avoided entirely.</p>
<h3>Why autonomy is important</h3>
        <p>One of the major challenges people with type 1 diabetes face is when others try to regulate their food. It can be frustrating and, if done in public, humiliating. </p>
<p>People with type 1 diabetes who feel free to make their own decisions and supported even when they make the wrong decisions tend to do better at managing their disease and they feel better emotionally. Those who experience blame or overprotective behaviours from others are less likely to monitor their blood sugars or adjust their insulin doses, and are more likely to binge eat.<sup>2</sup></p>
