          <label for="q1-a">
            <input type="radio" name="q0" id="q1-a" value="a" /> a. must take insulin for the rest of their lives. Otherwise, they will die. </label>

        </div>     
<div class="feedback-info alert alert-info sr-only">
<p>Feedback: Option a is correct. The treatment of diabetes depends on whether a person has type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin into their bodies multiple times a day to manage their blood sugar levels. Their bodies do not produce sufficient insulin for them to survive. Without injecting insulin, they will die. Those with type 2 diabetes may take pills and/or insulin to manage their blood sugar levels; some may be able to reverse it by improving their diet and activity levels.</p>

        <legend>Pam is at a wedding. She has type 1 diabetes and has been following Dr. Bernstein's low-carb diet, but decides to eat the food provided and have a piece of wedding cake. In front of the wedding guests, an aunt squeals at her, "You know you shouldn't be eating that!" Pam is obviously upset. What is the best response to the aunt you could say to support Pam? </legend>
        <div class="radio">
          <label for="q2-a">
            <input type="radio" name="q1" id="q2-a" value="a" /> a. It's OK. She knows how to cover it with insulin. </label>
        </div>
        <div class="radio">
          <label for="q2-b"> 
            <input type="radio" name="q1"  id="q2-b" value="b" /> b. She's probably just going to take a bite. Leave her alone. </label>
        </div>
        <div class="radio">
          <label for="q2-c">
            <input type="radio" name="q1"  id="q2-c" value="c" />  c. You're fatter than her! Put your own cake back. </label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback-info alert alert-info sr-only">
<p>Feedback: Option a is best. It shows you respect Pam's ability to take care of herself and that the other person needs to drop the topic. Option b makes the assumption that Pam shouldn't have as much cake as everyone else is having. Only Pam has the right to decide what she should have. Option c is just rude and will likely escalate the situation.</p>

        <legend>You have two friends with type 1 diabetes, Rana and Jess. Rana is trying a new whole-foods plant-based diet to deal with her stage 3 kidney disease. When you mention this to your friend Jess, she insists that the keto diet is best for those with type 1 diabetes and says that she has achieved excellent blood sugar control since starting. What do you do?</legend>
        <div class="radio">
          <label for="q3-a">
            <input type="radio" name="q2" id="q3-a" value="a" /> a. Advise Rana to abandon her new diet and try keto instead. </label>

        <div class="radio">
          <label for="q3-b"> 
            <input type="radio" name="q2"  id="q3-b" value="b" /> b. Mention Jess's success to Rana, but don't push it. Rana may have good reasons for not choosing keto. </label>
        </div>
        <div class="radio">
          <label for="q3-c">
            <input type="radio" name="q2"  id="q3-c" value="c" /> c. Tell Jess she doesn't know what she's talking about. Rana has obviously researched much more since she now has to deal with a complication from type 1 diabetes. </label>

                <div class="feedback-info alert alert-info sr-only">
<p>Feedback: Option b is best. Different diets may work best for different people. Sharing information may be helpful if you present it as an option to consider and not a cure or solution.</p>
