        <legend>A friend tells you she is a diabetic, but got off her insulin shots by taking cinnamon every day. You have a cousin with type 1 diabetes. What should you do?</legend>
        <div class="radio">
          <label for="off-shots-share">
            <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios-2" id="off-shots-share" value="a" /> a. Share this information with your cousin. It would be great if he could get off his insulin, too. </label>

          <label for="off-shots-mum"> 
            <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios-2"  id="off-shots-mum" value="b" /> b. Realize your friend must be a type 2 diabetic, and tell her you're happy for her. You don't say anything about this encounter to your cousin. </label>
        </div>
        <div class="radio">
          <label for="off-shots-mock">
            <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios-2"  id="off-shots-mock" value="c" />  c. Jokingly ask your friend if she also uses essential oils because apparently they are effective, too. You laugh about this conversation later with your cousin </label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback-correct alert alert-success sr-only">
          <p><span class="fa fa-check"></span> <strong>Correct!</strong> Option B is best. No supplement will eliminate your cousin's need for insulin. Bringing it up with your cousin later will irritate him if you think it is truly a cure. Even joking about it will contribute to his general frustration with people who don't know the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Keep both conversations positive!</p>

        <legend>Dave is at a Halloween party with his cousin Tim. Tim has type 1 diabetes, and he had a scary hypoglycemic episode about a month ago. Dave sees Tim grab a candy bar treat. Dave considers the following options. Which would be the best choice?</legend>
        <div class="radio">
          <label for="dave-take">
            <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios" id="dave-take" value="a" /> a. Quietly take the candy away from Tim and remind him of the hypoglycemic episode and the embarassment it had caused him. </label>

        <div class="radio">
          <label for="dave-ask"> 
            <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios"  id="dave-ask" value="b" /> b. Ask Tim if he is sure he wants that &mdash; it has a lot of sugar. </label>
        </div>
        <div class="radio">
          <label for="dave-ignore">
            <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios"  id="dave-ignore" value="c" />  c. Do nothing. Tim is an adult. </label>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback-correct alert alert-success sr-only">
          <p><span class="fa fa-check"></span> <strong>Correct!</strong> Option C is best. Tim is an adult who is responsible for his own decisions. He is not making a healthy choice, but neither is anyone else eating treats at the party. As long as Tim accurately tracks how many carbs he eats and gives an appropriate amount of insulin to cover it, he'll be ok, from a blood sugar standpoint. Neither taking away Tim's treat nor second-guessing his decision would help Tim achieve better control over his blood sugars; instead, these actions would build resentment and create distance between Tim and Dave.</p>
