          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In a normal person, blood sugar levels tend to be a constant 5.0
            mmol/L. They may rise slightly after a high-carb meal, or drop after
            exercise, but the body is usually able to quickly get the sugar
            levels back to a steady 5.0 mmol/L or so. A person with type 1
            diabetes has to perform the role of a healthy pancreas. They try to
            time insulin and food so that they reach the bloodstream at the same
            time, giving that straight line. Often, however, their attempts look
            more like a roller-coaster track, soaring into the teens or higher,
            then dipping down into the threes or even twos, and then soaring
            again. The specific blood glucose range they try to stay within
            varies from person to person, but is usually something similar to
            staying in the range of 4&ndash;10 mmol/L.
          </p>
          <h2>What causes high or low blood sugar?</h2>
          <p>
            There are many things that affect whether a blood sugar value stays
            steady, increases, or decreases.

          <h3>High Blood Sugar</h3>
          <p>
            A concern with high blood sugars is developing diabetic ketoacidosis
            (DKA). DKA occurs when the body does not get enough insulin, and it
            can be deadly. Because DKA develops due to lack of insulin, it is
            possible for a person to develop it even with normal blood sugar
            levels, for example, if they are sick and haven't taken any insulin
            because they've been vomiting and didn't want to have low blood
            sugars.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person with high blood sugar may need water or a sport drink with
            electrolytes to help flush the glucose out of their body and restore
            the appropriate electrolyte balance. They may avoid food or only
            eat low-carb foods such as green vegetables, eggs, meat, and cheese.
            Encourage them to take insulin to avoid going into diabetic
            ketoacidosis.
          </p>

          <p>
            A person in DKA needs to go to the hospital for proper treatment.
            This is not a situation that can be fixed at home. It requires
            carefully reintroducing insulin and the appropriate electrolytes,
            and typically requires spending time in the ICU. The longer a person
            in DKA delays in going to the hospital for treatment, the worse
            their outcomes are likely to be.
          </p>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h3>Low Blood Sugar</h3>
          <p>A concern with low blood sugar is going into a diabetic coma.</p>
          <p>
            A person with low blood sugar needs rapid-acting glucose to raise
            their blood sugar levels quickly. An appropriate correction dose is
            about 15 g of carbohydrates (e.g., 15 skittles or 4 glucose tablets
            or a small juice box). Having an additional follow-up snack with
            protein (e.g., peanut butter) is a good idea because it will help
            keep the blood sugar level steady.
          </p>
          <p>
            A person with low blood sugar who is unconscious or who is dropping
            faster than they can treat on their own may need glucagon. See the
            next section for information about how to administer glucagon.

            One problem people with type 1 diabetes encounter is that treating
            low blood sugar is done simply with food or drink. Sometimes it can
            be hard for others to realize that a packet of skittles isn't just a
            snack, and juice boxes are used for treating low blood sugars and not
            as a cola alternative.

              Never give the person insulin. If their blood sugar is low, you
              could kill them. If their blood sugar is so high that they are not
              conscious, they need trained medical assistance. This is not
              something that can be treated at home.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's always better to assume the person has low blood sugar and
              bring them something sugary to eat or drink. If their blood sugar
              is high, the little bit of sugar used to correct a low won't make
              a big difference. If they're low, the sugar can save their life.

              I went out for dinner and drinks with my brother and a friend. We
              had the drinks first because we were still full from a really late
              lunch, and the alcohol hit me fast. My insulin pump got knocked
              off and my friend and brother freaked out, and my friend called
              911. There was no issue &hellip; my blood sugar was in range, but
              they didn't know that. Well, as my friend was calling 911, another
              person out with us decided I needed insulin and injected me with
              100 units! That's more than I take for 3 days! My blood sugar
              dropped dangerously low in less than 5 minutes, and I passed out
              due to low blood sugar. EMS did all they could to get me back.
              Three bags of water plus 5 sugar shots later (I know this from
              what the doctor told me), I now have to stay in the ICU for 3 days
              because they have to get this all out of me. Who just gives
              someone a shot of insulin!? That person almost killed me.

              </li>

                When in doubt, assume a person with type 1 diabetes is
                experiencing low blood sugar and bring them something sweet (NOT
                diet), like a juice box.

          <h2>Giving glucagon for low blood sugars</h2>
          <p>
            If a person experiencing low blood sugar is unable to eat or drink,
            they may need a glucagon injection. Glucagon tells the liver to
            release some of the glucose it has stored into the bloodstream. Note
            that glucagon does NOT work if a person has had something to drink
            recently. The liver is busy dealing with the alcohol and won't
            respond to the glucagon.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Before giving a person an injection of
            glucagon, make sure you have their permission to use it on them in
            an emergency.
          </p>

            Watch this video to see how to give a glucagon injection (this video
            was designed for parents caring for their children, but applies to
            adults as well, following the directions for a child over 12 years
            of age).

            Health Canada recently approved a nasal glucagon kit. The glucagon
            is delivered through a nasal spray instead of requiring an
            injection.

            <p>
              Vomiting and dehydration can be very dangerous for a person with
              type 1 diabetes. For some people, it triggers DKA. Zara is upset
              that her friend would presume she would be okay with this, instead
              of checking first.

                b. Her blood sugar is fine. The junk food or something else is
                probably affecting her.

                <strong>Correct!</strong> Option A is most likely correct. Even
                though she has been eating lots of sweets, if she gave herself
                too much insulin, she could still be experiencing low blood
                sugar. Also, she's hot and acting weird, especially taking off
                her shirt. If she can't eat any more because she's been eating
                all night long, try juice or be prepared to give her a glucagon
                injection.
