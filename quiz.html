                      Feedback: Option a is correct. The treatment of diabetes
                      depends on whether a person has type 1 diabetes or type 2
                      diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin
                      into their bodies multiple times a day to manage their
                      blood sugar levels. Their bodies do not produce sufficient
                      insulin for them to survive. Without injecting insulin,
                      they will die. Those with type 2 diabetes may take pills
                      and/or insulin to manage their blood sugar levels; some
                      may be able to reverse it by improving their diet and
                      activity levels.

                    Pam is at a wedding. She has type 1 diabetes and has been
                    following Dr. Bernstein's low-carb diet, but decides to eat
                    the food provided and have a piece of wedding cake. In front
                    of the wedding guests, an aunt squeals at her, "You know you
                    shouldn't be eating that!" Pam is obviously upset. What is

                      ability to take care of herself and that the other person
                      needs to drop the topic. Option b makes the assumption
                      that Pam shouldn't have as much cake as everyone else is
                      having. Only Pam has the right to decide what she should
                      have. Option c is just rude and will likely escalate the

                    You have two friends with type 1 diabetes, Rana and Jess.
                    Rana is trying a new whole-foods plant-based diet to deal
                    with her stage 3 kidney disease. When you mention this to
                    your friend Jess, she insists that the keto diet is best for
                    those with type 1 diabetes and says that she has achieved
                    excellent blood sugar control since starting. What do you

                      may have good reasons for not choosing keto.

                      has obviously researched much more since she now has to

                      Feedback: Option b is correct. Sarah has been drinking and
                      dancing. Both activities typically lower blood sugar, so
                      she likely has low blood sugar. Glucagon is not effective
                      when someone has been drinking (the liver is busy
                      processing the alcohol), and insulin will only make the

                      juice and her meter so she can confirm her blood glucose
                      level and treat her low blood sugar herself. If she won't
